The Los Angeles Raiders would get a new Coliseum to play in, an immediate 
payment of more than $20 million and the promise of an additional $40 million 
over 10 years if owner Al Davis keeps his team in Los Angeles, under terms of 
an agreement currently in negotiation. 
Sources on both sides of the talks, who described the proposed deal, said 
chances that the team will stay in Los Angeles, rather than move to Oakland or 
Sacramento, seem to have improved in recent weeks. But serious legal obstacles 
and other impediments could block the settlement. 
For more than two years, the Raiders ultimate home has been up in the air, with 
first Irwindale, and later Sacramento and Oakland, in the bidding. There has 
been a steady inflation in the value of bids to Davis, but questions have 
arisen at each site on the ability to perform on the promises. 
According to one source, Davis agreed at a meeting Wednesday not to go ahead 
with a team move to either Oakland or Sacramento while developers from the 
Spectacor Management Group and MCA Inc., the private managers of the Coliseum, 
seek approval from the Coliseum Commission for a private ground lease that 
would allow the project to go ahead. 
At the same meeting, the source said, Davis successfully pushed for a bigger 
cash payment to the team, but how much bigger than $20 million was not 
disclosed. 
If the deal goes through, the Raiders would receive the largest fee ever paid 
to a professional team for staying where it is. Sources described the payment 
as settlement of the Coliseum Commission's pending lawsuit against the Raiders. 
Davis has not commented publicly on the discussions. But he said in a 
television interview Dec. 24 that he wants an "intimate" stadium for the 
Raiders, one with a low-enough seating capacity to escape television blackouts 
and with good, close-in sight lines for fans. 
Neither the Coliseum in Los Angeles nor the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum has such 
sight lines now. 
All sources close to the negotiations -- citing the delicate nature of the 
talks -- spoke to The Times on condition that they not be identified. 
Initial Payment 
The sources said that much of the initial payment to Davis would come from the 
$20 million the Coliseum Commission collected in damages from the National 
Football League in the lawsuit against the league for impeding the Raiders' 
move from Oakland in the early 1980s. 
In order to provide Davis with a tax-free grant, the money would be given to 
him in "settlement" of a $57-million lawsuit the Coliseum has filed against the 
Raiders for alleged breach of contract, sources said. Legal settlements are not 
taxable. 
But the money would later be reimbursed, with interest, to the Coliseum 
Commission by the private developers, the sources said. They insisted that only 
private money would ultimately be used and expressed confidence that bank 
financing could quickly be obtained by Spectacor, the prime mover in the 
project. 
Davis reportedly stated firmly at Wednesday's meeting that he is not bound by 
the terms of the deal, as it is currently described, even if the Coliseum 
Commission should approve the concept. This was an indication that, just as he 
did in Sacramento and Oakland, the Raiders' owner would press for better terms 
than he is being offered. 
One possible Davis move, a source said, would be to demand from the private 
developers a non-returnable advance payment, while they see if the project can 
be put together. Such a demand would be similar to the $10 million Irwindale 
gave the Raiders as earnest money in 1987, when the team said it would move 
there if a new stadium could be built. That money apparently will not be 
returned. 
Two sources told The Times that Davis gave assurances Wednesday that he would 
not require such an advance payment, which might compound the political 
difficulties of getting the project approved. But another source said he might 
yet do so. 
Nonetheless, Coliseum Commission President Richard Riordan, who has 
participated in some of the discussions, said later Wednesday the odds have 
increased that the Raiders can be persuaded not to leave Los Angeles. Riordan 
said that he hopes to come to an agreement before he gives up the commission 
presidency to attorney Matthew Grossman next month. 
Lease Proposed 
Under the proposed deal, the Coliseum Commission would give a ground lease, 
perhaps for as long as 30 years, to the private developers. The 92,000-seat 
Coliseum, the only stadium in the world that has hosted two modern Olympics, 
would be demolished, except for the eastern peristyle end. A new $125-million 
stadium, seating about 65,000 people, would be constructed in its place. 
This stadium would include 200 luxury boxes and 3,000 club seats that promoters 
expect could be marketed to corporate interests and wealthy individuals for 
millions of dollars a year. The stadium would also be expandable to more than 
80,000 seats for selected games, such as a Super Bowl or the USC-UCLA or 
USC-Notre Dame football games. 
According to Spectacor and MCA executives, the Raiders and USC might play at 
the Rose Bowl -- or, as a fallback, Anaheim Stadium -- during the year or two 
of Coliseum reconstruction. 
The promoters have even speculated in conversations with Davis that UCLA could 
not resist returning to a new Coliseum from the Rose Bowl, where they play 
under an agreement scheduled to expire in 1996. 
Inquiries made in the last two days, however, showed that UCLA officials are 
cool to any idea that they might quit the Rose Bowl, where their attendance has 
been better than it was in the Coliseum. 
Both Rose Bowl and Anaheim Stadium officials said no one has approached them 
about the Raiders and USC playing in their stadiums. 
Anaheim authorities appeared receptive to the idea of the Raiders and USC 
playing in Anaheim Stadium, although they cautioned that there could be 
scheduling conflicts with the Rams and the Angels. 
Shortage of Dates 
Pasadena Deputy City Manager Edward Aghjayan said a city policy, changeable 
only by a vote of the city's governing body, states that only 12 major events 
can take place in the Rose Bowl each year, and UCLA already has six. Under this 
policy, there are not enough open dates for the Raiders, much less USC. 
In addition, the Tournament of Roses committee, under a lease, has total 
control of the Rose Bowl in the month preceding the Rose Bowl game. December is 
an extremely important month for professional football games. 
Other inquiries raise these potential obstacles to the kind of project private 
developers are talking about with Davis: 
* The Coliseum Commission has a ground lease for the Coliseum from the Museum 
of Science and Industry, the state body that owns the site, which extends only 
to 2005. Because banks would probably require a longer deal to insure repayment 
of loans to finance the project, the lease would have to be renegotiated. 
Lawyers privy to the negotiations said no one has begun to look into this 
problem. According to the 1955 ground lease, the Coliseum Commission has an 
option to extend its lease in 2003 for 49 years but may do so only if it agrees 
with the museum board on what the rent should be. If there is a disagreement, 
then the rent would be increased from the current $50,000 a year in proportion 
to increases in Los Angeles County's total assessed valuation between 1955 and 
2003. 
All of this would be subject to negotiation, and the museum board has for a 
long time been leery of Coliseum-area redevelopment and might not prove a 
willing bargainer. 
* The Coliseum is both a state and a national historic landmark -- not just the 
peristyle end but the whole facility. Never before, according to a state 
historian contacted Wednesday, has a national historic landmark been 
demolished, and an elaborate and time-consuming procedure is required before 
state agencies rule on the matter. 
Maryln Lortie, historian in the registration section of the state Office of 
Historic Preservation, said the state code would require would-be Coliseum 
redevelopers to seek permission from state agencies to alter the facility in 
any substantive way. 
Disputes over what to do are ultimately reviewed by the state Office of 
Planning and Research. Only one project to alter a historic landmark has ever 
reached that level, and that proposal was finally scrapped, she said. 
Architect Ray Girvigian, chairman of the state Historic Building Code Board who 
was instrumental in getting the Coliseum designated a state and national 
landmark in 1984, said Wednesday, "I would look with great dismay on any 
proposal to destroy possibly the most significant landmark of its type, not 
only in California, but in the United States." 
* There are also major questions, lawyers said, about the charter under which 
the Coliseum is administered by a tripartite body, with three commissioners 
representing the city, the county and the state. Terms might well have to be 
renegotiated, a lengthy procedure that could require legislative approval. 
* An environmental impact report would be required before a project could 
proceed. In Irwindale, the environmental studies alone took more than a year.
