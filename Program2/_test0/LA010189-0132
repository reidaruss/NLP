One year ago, their election began the most complete overhaul of the San Diego 
City Council in a decade. Four educated, ambitious, politically savvy men -- 
they were the first group to take their seats together as newcomers since 1977. 
They were instantly nicknamed The Four Freshmen, and they almost as quickly 
predicted that they could become a force on the nine-member council. 
"We're going into office as a coalition of sorts," District 8 Councilman Bob 
Filner said the day after he was elected with the 2nd District's Ron Roberts, 
4th District's Wes Pratt and 6th District's Bruce Henderson. "People may wonder 
how or where the mayor and the current council members might get votes from us. 
But, on the other hand, with four of us coming in, we only need to pick up one 
vote to do what we want to." 
As Filner could best attest, it has not worked out that way. The freshmen's 
political differences soon dashed any semblance of a coalition forged in the 
heat of the campaign, and their fortunes have followed divergent paths. 
But each began to carve a niche for himself as the council fought and lost the 
battle to rein in growth, confirmed a new police chief, selected a site for a 
new Civic Center, grappled with an expensive sewage problem, authorized yet 
another study of how to relocate the airport, endorsed Mayor Maureen O'Connor's 
Soviet arts festival and raised hotel taxes to pay for it. 
Here is a look, in district order, at the Four Freshmen's first two semesters. 
The day after he was elected, District 2 Councilman, Ron Roberts promised to 
"hit the ground running." These days, it is said around City Hall, Roberts is 
running -- for mayor. 
A Friend to All Issues 
Roberts, whose district stretches from Point Loma to Mission Hills, greets 
returning warships, fires starter's pistols at track meets, cuts ribbons, 
accepts awards and gives speeches. His energy is so boundless, his presence so 
ubiquitous, his name in the news so often, that it is difficult to remember he 
has been on council only a year. 
Roberts has yet to meet an issue he doesn't like. Whether it is growth 
management, safety and noise at Lindbergh Field or sewage treatment and water 
reclamation, Roberts has studied it, and he has a plan for improving it. 
More than any of the four new council members -- perhaps more than any other 
council member except Gloria McColl -- Roberts has nimbly stepped into the 
power vacuum created by the city's weak mayor form of government and O'Connor's 
hands-off leadership style. 
Mixed Reviews 
At year's end, he had positioned himself in a tenuous coalition of five 
moderate-to-conservative Republicans that could dominate the nine-member 
council if its members can overcome longstanding differences among them. At the 
same time, he remains close to O'Connor, who endorsed only him among the eight 
candidates in the 1987 election. 
Some of Roberts' adventures have backfired. An attempt to remove the city's 
highly successful Motion Picture and Television Bureau from the Chamber of 
Commerce led to an embarrassing defeat and ill will from the chamber. "I would 
do that differently if I had it all to do over again," he said. 
Slow-growth activists, who had high hopes for Roberts when O'Connor endorsed 
him as "someone who knows how to say 'no' to developers," now consider him the 
architect of some of Proposition H's worst features. 
"Ron Roberts talks like Mr. Rogers but votes like Attila the Hun," was a 
standard campaign stump line from Citizens for Limited Growth's Peter Navarro. 
Roberts deftly handles speculation about his ambition. "The things I'm doing 
are because that's how I interpret the job of being on the council. If there 
is, at a later date, a reward in citizens 
saying, 'We're willing to to let you step up to a higher office,' that's fine." 
O'Connor, who this month began a new four-year term in office, has heard the 
whispers about Roberts' ambition but is unconcerned. 
"I have to tell you, I think they're all running for mayor. Everybody's running 
for mayor. Secretly, and I'll talk generically, any council member who serves 
as a council member has kind of a little, secret desire to one day be mayor," 
she said. 
"My philosophy is 'good government is good politics,' " she added, "I work 
hard, I try to serve the community well. It's their choice. What will be will 
be." 
High-Profile Concerns 
Blessed with intelligence, drive and an All-American, good-guy personality, 
Roberts has benefited from the fact that the issues he is best able to tackle 
are among the city's most high-profile concerns. 
Roberts' district includes Lindbergh Field, so he is a natural to work on the 
pressing matters of noise and safety at the airport -- issues watched closely 
throughout the region. Point Loma is home to the city's only sewage treatment 
plant, so Roberts has become outspoken on the city's need for a $1.5-billion 
upgrading of its sewer-treatment system, and, more specifically, on the need to 
develop water reclamation technology. 
As an architect and former chairman of the Planning Commission, Roberts was 
installed as chairman of the committee that wrote Proposition H, the council's 
growth-management plan. He became the leading spokesman for it during the 
unsuccessful election campaign. 
But Roberts' success is mostly of his own making. He worked with Point Loma 
residents and the Port District to fashion the compromise plan approved this 
month that will limit noise from takeoffs and landings at Lindbergh. He has 
ridden in an airplane cockpit to assess the danger, if any, posed by the Laurel 
Travel Center building at the foot of the airport runway. He is involved in 
discussions with the Navy to reshape the landscape at the foot of Broadway. 
Somehow, Roberts finds time for his district. He has worked to revitalize Ocean 
Beach and is helping Point Loma's planning board devise ways to lessen 
peak-hour traffic, caused largely by sailors, on Catalina Boulevard and 
Rosecrans Street. 
"That man is working day and night," said Ann Jackson, chairman of the 
Peninsula Community Planning Board. "I feel very fortunate that he chose to 
leave the architectural profession and try serving the city and the community. 
He's doing a wonderful job." 
Roberts points to a new downtown plan, a new waterfront plan, the 
growth-control debate and the airport as his major issues in 1989. He also will 
be heavily involved in the council's redistricting efforts and is rumored to 
want to add a chunk of downtown to his district. 
Wes Pratt took office, took one look at the crying needs in his impoverished 
council district and took to the streets of Southeast San Diego. He lectures 
schoolchildren on the evils of drugs, marches to protest gang violence and goes 
door-to-door exhorting homeowners in the battle against crack dealers. 
Long before district elections were approved by voters in the November, Pratt, 
the council's lone black member, focused his energy on the concerns of his 
largely minority constituents in the 4th District, which includes Southeast San 
Diego, Encanto, Paradise Hills and most of the California 94 corridor. If that 
meant that his colleagues would grab the limelight, so be it. 
"I decided I would simply concentrate on district-related issues and getting 
out into the district," he said. 
His record is true to that decision. In his first year, Pratt sought more money 
for social services to AIDS victims, a growing concern of the minority 
community. He championed the losing Charter Review Commission ballot initiative 
for a tough police review board and was critical of the police shooting of 
Tommie Dubose during an arrest. 
He was actively involved in the negotiations to sell Southeast's San Diego 
Physicians &amp; Surgeons Hospital, and at year's end was leading the effort to 
have the city's Convention Center named for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the 
slain civil rights leader 
Staying Above the Fray 
Pratt has developed a reputation for staying above the fray on City Hall's 10th 
floor, where the deal-cutting and alliance-building among council members can 
be fast-paced. That stance has allowed Pratt to acquire some power as a 
somewhat unpredictable swing vote on the nine-member council. It was Pratt, for 
example, who came back from his sickbed to break a 4-4 tie on the size of the 
increase of the city's hotel room tax. 
"I didn't ask to be in that position," he said. "It's just the way I conduct 
myself in the City Council is to be pretty straightforward and not ally myself 
with one faction or another." 
Herb Cawthorne, executive director of the San Diego Urban League, believes 
Pratt "has done an exceptional job. He's surprised a lot of people with his 
ability to grasp the larger issues. He has a tremendous amount of pressure on 
him, because his balance makes him the swing factor a lot of times. 
"I think, as he matures, he will learn to exercise the power in more 
far-reaching ways," Cawthorne added. 
George Stevens, an aide to Rep. Jim Bates (D-San Diego) and Pratt's opponent in 
the council race, praises Pratt for his stand on the police review issue and 
for his responsiveness to neighborhood needs. 
But Stevens believes that Pratt should be supporting a committee recommendation 
to include King's full name in the convention center title instead of Pratt's 
proposal of "San Diego King Convention Center." And he believes Pratt should 
have gotten an even larger share of this year's Community Development block 
grant money than the $2 million his district received. 
A rare politician who does not feel the need to give extended speeches before 
each vote, the quiet, burly Pratt has earned the respect of colleagues with his 
allegiance to doing what is right. 
"Wes Pratts don't come along very often," said Mayor Maureen O'Connor. "He's 
got a rare quality about him." And "99% of the time he's on the side of the 
angels," she added. 
"I basically want to be about the business of good government," Pratt said. "I 
will continue to do that. I don't feel I have to wave a big flag. Wes Pratt is 
not going to be here forever. People have to take up the mantle and serve." 
Bruce Henderson has taken a prominent role in some important citywide and 
district issues. Henderson was the architect of Proposition K, the advisory 
ballot measure calling for a mandatory, citywide program of staggered work 
hours to reduce peak-hour traffic congestion. 
Along with several other council members, he has championed an ordinance to 
preserve single-family neighborhoods, which make up a sizable part of his 6th 
District, which includes Pacific Beach, Mission Beach and Clairemont. He led 
the fight to equip the city's police force with two helicopters captured from 
drug runners. One chopper is now operating and the other is being outfitted. 
Henderson continues to be the council's maverick on its $1.5-billion sewer 
system upgrade, insisting that the effort is not necessary. He also led 
opposition to a $1.5-million consulting contract to publicize the issue, 
narrowly losing his effort to sharply reduce the program, but managing to pare 
$300,000 from the price tag. 
Despite that sizable first-year agenda, Henderson is best known inside City 
Hall for the publicity stunts, his long, sometimes unfocused speeches and his 
class-clown tendency to interrupt colleagues during council sessions. 
Blowup Sharks, Posters 
Henderson has filled the council chamber with the ominous background music from 
the film "Jaws" and adorned the room with inflatable sharks to make his point 
that "consultant sharks" are feeding on public tax dollars. He altered a "Jaws" 
poster to show the shark munching a dollar bill. 
His "Fly Me" poster focused attention on the helicopters. He handed out a 
commuter survival kit at a press conference to exhort voters to approve 
Proposition K. 
Henderson has "a sense of humor, a different way of doing things," said 
O'Connor, who concedes she has at times become exasperated trying to silence 
Henderson at council meetings. "He has fun and doesn't take it personally. . . 
. He does make you laugh. 
"He tries to exaggerate to make his point. And, through his exaggerations, he 
makes his points. That's his way of doing it." 
Henderson agrees that he's trying "just to have a little fun" during council 
meetings that can stretch eight hours or more. 
"The sharks captured the council's attention," he said. "I didn't win, but at 
least I saved the city $300,000." 
Admits to 'Fine Line' 
But, he acknowledges, "I have to be careful because there's a fine line between 
using them and amusing (council members) and over-using them and irritating 
(council members)." 
Behind the clowning, council members agree, is a keen mind and a financial 
acumen that many other council members lack. Henderson has also concentrated on 
his district, focusing on a traffic study of Mission Bay, Pacific Beach and La 
Jolla and closely scrutinizing requests for exemptions from the city's Interim 
Development Ordinance in his neighborhoods. 
He has also maneuvered himself into the chairmanship of the Public Facilities 
and Recreation Committee, where he will have a more direct impact on Mission 
Bay Park. 
Henderson was perhaps the council's most outspoken opponent of the 
growth-management plan, though he did vote for it after weeks of negotiation. 
"I didn't like H . . ., " he said of Proposition H. "I was very pleased by the 
voters, that they rejected it." Henderson called the voters' decision "a 
reaffirmation of representative democracy," because it put the future of growth 
management back in the council's hands. 
Henderson, "I think, has been less of an environmental supporter than we had 
expected," said Barbara Bamberger, the Sierra Club's conservation coordinator. 
"And we didn't expect much." 
This has not been Bob Filner's month. 
It started Nov. 29 when a coalition of five council members relieved him of 
$1.7 million in Community Development block grant funds that City Manager John 
Lockwood had recommended for his 8th District. The following day, the same 
group turned down O'Connor's suggestion that Filner head a council committee 
and installed Henderson as chairman instead. 
A week later, they were at it again, refusing to allow Filner to represent the 
council on the Metropolitan Transit Development Board. 
Filner's colleagues say they were trying to teach him a lesson. They say he is 
abrasive, that he takes political and philosophical debate and raises it to the 
level of personal attack. 
"Bob tends to personalize it: 'you're evil, you're bad, you're mean, you've 
broken the law, and I don't like you, and I'm going to take my football and go 
home,' " Henderson said. 
Roberts, one of the group of moderate-to-conservative Republicans who 
engineered Filner's thrashing, claims he was motivated by Filner's attempt, 
during back-corridor wrangling over committee chairmanships, to put together a 
slate that would have left Roberts without a chairmanship. 
Convenient Target? 
Filner remains defiant, claiming that the group he has dubbed "the Gang of 
Five" was motivated by common ideological and political goals, not personal 
ones. As perhaps the council's most liberal member, Filner believes he makes a 
convenient target. 
"The defeat of the H and J has emboldened the pro-development forces on the 
council," he said, referring to council members Ron Roberts, Bruce Henderson, 
Judy McCarty, Ed Struiksma and Gloria McColl. "I think that's what is behind 
some of the recent votes with the Gang of Five. 
"There's an ideological, partisan effort to make sure I am kept weak," he said. 
He does not deny trying to put together a slate of committee chairmen without 
Roberts on it. "Why is my attempting to put together a slate that's helpful to 
me any worse or better than his trying to put together a slate that's 
beneficial to him?," he asked. 
The answer is that Roberts had the votes to win and Filner didn't. Votes are 
the bottom line, said Andrea Skorepa, executive director of a San Ysidro social 
service agency and a Filner antagonist who supported his opponent, Mike 
Aguirre, in the most recent election. 
"I think, for our community, he hasn't been as effective a representative as he 
could be," she said. 
Earlier in the year, Filner watched helplessly as the council overruled his 
recommendation and gave a publicly run recreation center in his district to 
Skorepa's organization. 
The internal conflict has overshadowed Filner's accomplishments in his large, 
meandering district, which stretches from Hillcrest through downtown and 
includes San Ysidro and Otay Mesa. A fanatical worker, he is perhaps the 
council's most cerebral member, who has a tendency to intellectual honesty even 
if his views are not politically popular. He is on leave from San Diego State 
University, where he teaches history. 
Variety of Concerns 
Filner was the only council member to oppose placing Charter Commission 
initiatives directly on the ballot without review, arguing that the position 
was an abdication of the council's responsibilities. In recent months, some of 
his colleagues have begun to agree. 
Filner guided the Balboa Park Master Plan to adoption, insisting that it call 
for maximizing open space. He has brought capital improvement funds to South 
Bay parks and worked on the revitalization of San Ysidro Boulevard. Last month 
he called for higher taxes to put more police on city streets. 
Filner has proven himself one of the council's most ardent slow-growth 
advocates and remains a solid pro-environment vote. He has defended the Sierra 
Club from attempts to oust the organization from its Balboa Park office. 
"Bob Filner is one of the few consistent supporters, who has been out there and 
has been aggressively fighting for the preservation of open space and sensitive 
lands," said the Sierra Club's Bamberger. 
Filner pledged to soften his tone if it will mean more success for his 
district, which could be vulnerable in next year's redistricting. 
"I'm willing to look at my own behavior," he said. "If it's hurting me from 
achieving things for my district, that will change." 
But he adds: "I'm an outspoken person. I represent a district that has 
historically been powerless. I'm going to continue to (be outspoken). If that 
gets me into trouble, so be it."
