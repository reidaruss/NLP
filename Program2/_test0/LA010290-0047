When Southern California residents fill out their 1990 census forms this 
spring, most will assume that they're participating in more than just another 
marketing survey. The census, after all, is carried out by the federal 
government under a constitutional mandate, and its avowed purpose is to count 
the population so that political representation and government funds can be 
properly distributed. 
But the census also serves as a comprehensive study of American consumers, 
producing reams of information on the income and life styles of people who live 
in a certain county or on a particular city block. It's the kind of demographic 
information that makes marketing strategists drool, and no other data source 
can touch the census in terms of its scope and accuracy. 
It's no surprise, then, that census information is sold and resold and 
reshuffled for an incredible array of business purposes. "Virtually every 
business uses census data," said Mark Baldassare, a professor of social ecology 
at the University of California, Irvine who uses the census extensively 
himself. "It's omnipresent." 
Retailers use census information in deciding where to locate new stores. Banks 
use it in determining how to market certificates of deposit. Health-care 
companies use it to plan new services. Maura Eggan, marketing director for 
South Coast Plaza, puts it simply, "The census shows where our customers are, 
and in what numbers." 
The basic census questionnaire -- which will be sent to every home in the 
country by April 1 -- simply records the number of people in a household, their 
ages, sex, marital status, race and the type of housing in which they reside. 
That's useful information for any marketing department. 
But even more mouthwatering is the information that comes from the so-called 
long form, or sample form -- sent to one out of every six households, which 
involves 45 additional questions that elicit detailed information on household 
income, mortgage payments, commuting patterns, energy usage and many other 
matters. 
The volume of information collected in the census is so staggering, however, 
that making good use of it can be difficult. 
The Census Bureau, which spends $2.6 billion collecting the information, does 
not slice and dice the data to fit every possible use, and not many businesses 
have the computer equipment or manpower to crunch the numbers themselves. 
The basic data set has another liability: With 10 years between censuses, it 
gets old. And it takes the Census Bureau so long to compile everything -- the 
basic 1990 "head count" should be ready by year-end, but much of the more 
detailed data will not be available until 1993 -- that some of the information 
is old even before it's published. 
Solving these two problems is how the raft of independent information vendors 
make their livings. Companies such as Donnelley Marketing Information Services, 
National Planning Data Corp., Urban Decision Systems Inc. and National Decision 
Systems function as what Jeri Denniston, marketing manager at National 
Decisions Systems in Encinitas, calls "value-added resellers of census data." 
For a price, these firms will provide demographic data for any population area. 
Thinking of a new store at a certain intersection? A profile of the population 
within a 2-mile radius of that intersection -- or a 20-mile radius, or a 
200-mile radius -- is just a phone call away. "We repackage, reformat and 
resell the data in bite-sized chunks," said Jim Paris, senior associate at Los 
Angeles-based Urban Decision Systems Inc. 
The Census Bureau tabulates data in a geographic hierarchy that begins with 
city blocks and moves through groups of blocks, cities, counties, states and 
the nation as a whole. But, for example, pulling out the precise block groups 
that are necessary to define a certain area can be a painstaking process for 
the unequipped. 
The information vendors also continually update the census information and 
develop projections by using sophisticated statistical techniques and other 
sources of information varying from state Department of Finance surveys to 
postal delivery records. Donnelley also incorporates information collected by 
other units of parent company Dun &amp; Bradstreet, such as A. C. Nielsen and 
Dun's Marketing Services. 
And for customers who want it, the information companies will go even further 
and overlay highly detailed life style profiles onto the demographic profiles. 
They'll tell you not only how much money people in a certain neighborhood make, 
how much education they have, and how many cars they own (information that 
comes directly from the census), but also what make of car they're likely to 
drive, how often they eat out, and what vacation destinations they frequent 
(information extrapolated from marketing and sociological studies). 
Sometimes the census data is several times removed from its original source. 
Several years ago, Mel Curland needed more Volvos for his booming Mission Viejo 
dealership, but he was having trouble persuading executives in Sweden to give 
him a larger allocation. The tremendous affluence and high growth rates in 
southern Orange County, it seems, were not very obvious to Stockholm. 
Curland needed figures to show that the people in his market area fit Volvo's 
profile of the typical Volvo customer. 
He got those figures from Market Profiles, a Costa Mesa consulting company, 
which had, in turn, purchased them from Urban Decision Systems, which itself 
had bought them from the Census Bureau and then updated them with some of its 
own data. Curland said he ultimately got the additional cars. 
Larger businesses, however, often get closer to the primary source. Census 
information can be purchased directly from the Census Bureau in printed form or 
on computer tapes, and this year for the first time some data will be offered 
on optical disks, as well. 
Buying the tapes -- at about $175 each -- is a practical option only if a 
company has a mainframe computer and some in-house programming capabilities, 
but for big companies that's not too big an obstacle. 
Jim Stiles, marketing research manager at FHP Inc., a health maintenance 
organization in Fountain Valley, said his company has purchased directly from 
the Census Bureau as well as from outside providers, but that it is now relying 
more heavily on the latter. "The bureau is a data dumper. You can filter it 
yourself, but it gets to be a headache," he said. "The vendors will organize it 
for you." 
FHP, Stiles added, uses the information for a broad variety of purposes. If the 
company is considering entering a new market area, it will look at the profile 
of the population there and see how it compares with areas where the company 
currently does well. In an existing market area, the company will compare the 
characteristics of members and non-members to see who is using the services. 
FHP also uses census data classified by ZIP code to assist in its targeted 
mailing efforts, an application that is extremely valuable for any company that 
sells its products or services via the post office. 
And though the information vendors claim that their updates are extremely 
accurate -- and that the new data from the 1990 census is therefore not a huge 
event -- some of the users are not so sure. Stiles noted that the projections 
get weaker and weaker every year beyond the census and that staying up-to-date 
is especially difficult in a fast-growing and fast-changing area such as Orange 
County. 
The 1990 census form, although mostly unchanged from 1980, contains a few 
innovations that will make it even more useful for local businesses. For 
example, the multiple-choice question on housing value now uses $500,000 or 
over as the top classification; the old category of $200,000 or over was 
virtually useless in much of Southern California. 
Bankers are excited that the census will for the first time ask about second 
mortgages, one of the hottest areas of bank lending. 
And though everyone will have to wait a couple of more years for all the 
information, the data promises to be more accessible than ever before. Not only 
are there more information vendors doing more things with it, but the Census 
Bureau itself is also working to disseminate the data in more usable forms. 
Larry Hugg, an information specialist with the Census Bureau's regional office 
in Van Nuys, noted that some information will now be available not only in 
published reports -- the basic source for seven out of 10 users -- and computer 
tapes, but also on optical disks that can be read by properly equipped personal 
computers. 
In addition, the data is available on-line through some electronic information 
services, and the bureau will produce printouts of data that is not contained 
in published reports. 
And considering what you get, it's not very expensive. Summary reports in 
published form cost from $29 to $50, and in 1980 the entire census data bank -- 
711 mainframe computer tapes -- could be purchased for $124,425, said Paris of 
Urban Decision Systems. Hugg said there will be "thousands" of tapes for the 
1990 count, so it might be a bit more expensive. 
VALUABLE DATA: 1990 is the year of the census, and that's a boon for marketing 
strategists. The nationwide count yields unequaled demographic information.
