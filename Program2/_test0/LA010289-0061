The Los Angeles Times' panel of distinguished economists reached a standoff 
this year, equally divided over whether 1989 will be the year that a recession 
finally halts America's longest postwar boom. 
But the six members of The Times' Board of Economists who participated in the 
year-end survey more or less agreed that three key issues will determine 1989's 
economic fate. These are whether the Bush Administration and Congress will 
agree on meaningful steps to lower the budget deficit; the reactions of foreign 
investors, especially the Japanese, to economic developments here, and whether 
American consumers, loaded down with record levels of debt, will nevertheless 
continue to spend beyond their means. 
As always, the Federal Reserve Board's role in setting interest rates, largely 
in response to these issues, also is considered crucial. 
The economists' forecasts differ so widely mainly because they hinge on 
predictions of human behavior and the outcome of political maneuvering in 
Washington, rather than simple number-crunching. 
Six Participants 
The bright note this year is that the board of economists as a group is 
somewhat less pessimistic now than a year ago. Jarred by the October, 1987, 
stock market crash, five out of eight board members last year predicted 
recession in 1988. But the American economy romped right past the crash, 
growing by at least 2.6% last year. 
Only six economists participated this year because two have been enlisted in 
the service of the Bush Administration. Michael A. Boskin resigned from the 
board because he was named chairman of the President's Council of Economic 
Advisers. Board member Allan H. Meltzer, a professor of political economy and 
public policy at Carnegie Mellon University, declined to participate because he 
is now serving as an adviser to the President's council. 
The three who predict no recession in 1989 are George L. Perry, a senior fellow 
at the Brookings Institution in Washington; Paul R. Krugman, a professor of 
economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Irwin L. Kellner, 
chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover in New York. 
But those who predict that the expansion will come to an end in what is now its 
seventh year are Robert Lekachman, professor of economics at Lehman College of 
the City University of New York and author of "Visions and Nightmares: America 
After Reagan"; David M. Gordon, economics professor at the New School for 
Social Research in New York, and A. Gary Shilling, a New York-based economic 
consultant and author of "The World Has Definitely Changed." 
While the budget deficit has been a big concern in past years, this year the 
economists agree that it is a pivotal question for the U.S. economy in 1989. 
One reason is that the budget deficit, and the related U.S. trade deficit, have 
become key determinants for how foreign investors and foreign central bankers 
react, driving the dollar down or up, and making foreign capital for investment 
here plentiful or scarce. 
Recession Scenario 
The two economists who believe that Congress and the new President will be able 
to agree promptly on budgetary steps serious enough to impress the jittery 
world markets predicted that the economic expansion will continue at least one 
more year, although the economy will probably grow at a slower rate. One, 
Krugman, predicted no recession even though he doubts that there will be much 
progress on the deficit this year. 
But the rest, who don't expect agreement this year on spending cuts or a 
combination of spending cuts and tax increases predicted a recession. 
The recession scenario generally goes like this: A marked failure to do 
something about the deficit could cause the dollar to drop dramatically against 
major foreign currencies such as the yen and the West German mark as foreign 
investors conclude that the U.S. economy isn't such a good investment and 
foreign central bankers decide that there is no longer any point to propping up 
the dollar. The Fed responds by sharply raising interest rates to attract back 
foreign investors (higher interest rates on investments help compensate 
investors for a depreciating dollar) and to choke off inflation that may be 
caused by more expensive imports. 
But a big hike in interest rates could easily end the expansion and would be 
particularly dangerous at a time when both individuals and companies are loaded 
up with record levels of debt. 
Making the situation even more fragile, says Shilling, is that record amounts 
of both personal and company debt are now subject to fluctuating, variable-rate 
interest payments. This includes variable-rate mortgages, home equity loans and 
credit card accounts for individuals, as well as variable-rate borrowing by 
companies. As a result, Shilling says, any big hike in interest rates would be 
felt almost immediately throughout the economy, triggering bankruptcies and an 
abrupt drop-off of consumer spending. 
Shilling foresees a recession starting in the first half of 1989, setoff in 
part by the Fed raising interest rates to choke off a perceived threat of 
renewed inflation and to make up for an expected loss of confidence in the 
American economy by foreign investors. "It will be a classic case of the Fed 
being forced to raise short-term interest rates to recession-precipitating 
levels," he says. 
Shilling also sees the first strong signs in some time of fear by industry that 
inflation, currently at a relatively low rate of 4.5% annually as measured by 
the consumer price index, is about to take off. Companies, he says, are doing 
the first hedge-buying of inventory -- stocking up on supplies in expectation 
that prices are about to go up -- since the 1970s. 
Lekachman, another predictor of recession, owns up to having forecast a 
downturn every year for the past four years. But he maintains that "the chances 
are about 2 to 1 that by the fourth quarter of 1989, we'll see the recession." 
He predicts that the main cause will be Japanese investors and Japan's central 
bank, responding to what they view as a weak U.S. President and a political 
"mess" in Washington's approach to the deficit. Lekachman notes that the United 
States depends on a massive influx of foreign capital and says he detects signs 
that the Japanese are increasingly willing to throw their weight around on the 
global economic scene. 
Reprieve Predicted 
If the Japanese lose confidence in Bush's ability to reduce the deficit, they 
may well reduce their buying at U.S. Treasury auctions, which in turn could 
sharply push up U.S. interest rates. "This will be the classic trigger for a 
recession," he says. 
Gordon foresees a particularly deep recession. "It's going to be pretty nasty 
because of the mountainous levels of personal and corporate debt," he says. 
But Kellner, a member of The Times' board who last year predicted a recession, 
this year thinks the economy will squeak by with another reprieve. Kellner 
thinks that despite the political problems, the Bush Administration will win an 
agreement this year with legislators on a plan to eliminate the deficit over 
four years. This, he maintains, would be enough to satisfy foreign investors 
and Japanese and European governments and allow the Fed to ease up on its 
current tight-money policy. 
In addition, Kellner predicts a slackening of consumer spending sufficient to 
keep inflation in check but not severe enough to induce a recession. Of the six 
economists, Kellner alone expects consumer spending to slow significantly 
without a sharp jolt of higher interest rates first. 
Economic forecasters consider consumer spending extremely important to their 
calculations since it makes up about two-thirds of the nation's economic 
activity. (Slightly under half of this goes for items bought in stores, the 
rest goes for rent, health care, transportation and other services.) 
Kellner believes that consumers are getting exhausted from years of increased 
spending and are about to cut back. With employment high, he says, "There is no 
pent-up demand for big ticket items people delayed buying because they were out 
of work." 
He also notes that prices of expensive consumer items have risen faster than 
most peoples' incomes. "Given that the cost of big-ticket items has gone up 
faster than incomes, people have bought about all they're going to buy," he 
asserts. As evidence, he cites the fact that consumer spending, adjusted for 
inflation, was lower this fall than it was two years earlier. 
The rest of The Times panel, however, doubts that consumers are likely to begin 
acting so rationally. Some say that during the past eight years, encouraged by 
the economic boom and the Republican Administration's supply side economics, 
the habit of spending much and saving little has become ingrained. "Ronald 
Reagan . . . really has gone a long distance to reinforce the American attitude 
of spend today, pay tomorrow," says Lekachman. 
Shilling, too, sees no signs of consumer spending slowing down. He notes that 
the stock market crash didn't shock consumers into spending less. "The consumer 
just isn't giving up," he said. "People are way overextended. They're borrowing 
to pay their bills. People don't want to give up on the American dream of 
ever-increasing purchasing power." 
'Economy Pretty Healthy' 
Early indications that 1988 Christmas buying was relatively strong seem to give 
credit to those who see no falloff of consumer spending. One fear is that 
continued strong consumer demand will add to inflationary pressures, forcing 
the Fed to continue raising interest rates. 
But Perry, although he foresees little change in consumer spending levels this 
year, says he isn't particularly worried. "I think the economy is pretty 
healthy," he states, adding that he thinks a recession in 1989 is unlikely. 
"People have predicted it every year, and every year they've been wrong," he 
says. 
He believes that the economy is slowing a bit and that the gross national 
product -- a measure of all goods and services produced in the economy -- will 
continue to grow at an acceptably low rate of about 3% in 1989. Perry doubts 
that foreigners will become so concerned about the U.S. economic situation that 
they will begin dumping dollars. And he said that any substantial improvement 
in the budget deficit would be met by a decline in interest rates. 
He gives the Fed credit for keeping growth rates and inflation in check. "The 
Fed is doing what it traditionally has done, to lean against the wind," Perry 
says. "It sees an expansion that is still pretty vigorous, and it's letting 
interest rates rise to take a little steam out." 
Krugman, while not completely ruling out the possibility of recession in 1989, 
sees a greater risk of an overheating economy. "The fundamentals are that we 
still have very strong domestic demand and a weak dollar," he says. He believes 
that the Fed will continue to nudge up interest rates, even enough to send some 
highly leveraged companies into bankruptcy. But because demand is so strong, he 
doesn't predict a full-fledged recession. Because with the wave of corporate 
takeovers and leveraged buyouts companies are heavily indebted, "what we have 
is a strange economy -- you could have a lot of bankrupt companies working at 
(full) capacity."
