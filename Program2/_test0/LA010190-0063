TOP PRO EXECUTIVE 
Jack McKeon, Padres: McKeon, hired as vice president/baseball operations in 
September 1980, turned the Padres' franchise from a laughingstock into a prized 
possession. And as the citizens of San Diego have learned, it's not wise to 
become emotionally attached to any player. McKeon has engineered trades 
involving 165 players since his arrival. Their 1990 spring-training roster 
consists of just four players -- Tony Gwynn, Eric Show, Garry Templeton and Ed 
Whitson -- who opened the 1987 season with them. They don't call him Trader 
Jack for nothing. 
TOP MALE PRO ATHLETE 
Tony Gwynn, Padres: It took just one minor league season for the Padres to be 
convinced that they had something special on their hands. Of course, when 
you've got a guy batting .331 in rookie league and .462 in double-A, it doesn't 
take a genius to figure he might have some major league talent. What 
materialized was four National League batting championships, five All-Star 
appearances and an image that would put Wally Cleaver to shame. Gwynn is the 
pride and joy of the Padres, and one day just might be standing behind a podium 
at Cooperstown, being inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
Others considered: Dan Fouts (Chargers). 
TOP FEMALE PRO ATHLETE 
Paula Newby-Fraser, triathlete: Since moving to Encinitas from England in 1985, 
Newby-Fraser has become a household name on the triathlon circuit. She has won 
three Ironman Triathlons and more than 40 other championships, including the 
two in San Diego this year, the Bud Light and San Diego International. For 
winning all of these titles, she has won more than $100,000. A native of 
Zimbabwe, South Africa, Newby-Fraser started her racing career in Europe in 
1985. She finished third in the Ironman Triathlon that year -- and then got 
serious. 
Others considered: Wendy MacPherson (bowling), Robin White (tennis). 
TOP PRO COACH 
Ron Newman, Sockers: He has had plenty of critics, including players who don't 
always see eye-to-eye with his sometimes unorthodox methods. But the Sockers 
have won seven championships this decade under him. Newman has always had a 
knack for molding players from all over the world, with vastly different 
backgrounds, into a unit that wins. They fight, but they win. Newman has also 
established himself as an innovator, coming up with new strategies each season 
to keep a step ahead of other coaches -- and even the referees. 
TOP PRO TEAM 
The Sockers: Who else? Seven championships. Each year, they have to think up a 
new slogan. We've seen: "Twice is not Enough." "Keep the Streak Alive." "One 
for the Thumb." "The Joy of Six." "Seven is Heaven." Every few years, new 
players come in to boost them to a new title. Mainstays of the first group were 
Juli Veee, Jean Willrich and Kaz Deyna. Brian Quinn and Kevin Crow came along 
in 1983, Branko Segota and Steve Zungul in 1984. And goalies Zoltan Toth and 
Victor Nogueira have anchored championships the past two seasons. The biggest 
threat to the Sockers' dominance in the '80s wasn't any one particular team but 
the Major Indoor Soccer League, which nearly folded several times because of 
financial difficulties. 
TOP 1-YEAR PRO TEAM 
1984 Padres: The improbable Padres, never before taken seriously, rode their 
second winning season all the way to their first World Series. They captured 
the hearts of the city like no other sports team, and maybe that's what helped 
them reach the Series. Nobody wanted the fun to end. They finished the regular 
season 92-70 but opened the National League playoffs in Chicago by dropping two 
consecutive games. Facing a sweep, the Padres returned to San Diego after Game 
2 to find a few thousand fans waiting in the San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium 
parking lot. Recharged, the Padres became the first team in NL Championship 
Series play, and the second team in Championship Series history, to overcome an 
0-2 deficit and win a series. The fun finally ended, though, when the Padres 
were defeated by Detroit in the World Series, four games to one. 
Others considered: 1980 Chargers, 1981 Chargers, 1984-85 Sockers, 1985-86 
Sockers, 1987-88 Sockers. 
TOP PRO GAME 
1981-82 NFL playoffs, Chargers vs. Dolphins: On the day after New Year's, 1982, 
Rolf Benirschke's 27-yard field goal at 13:52 of overtime finished a dramatic, 
41-38, Charger victory in the Orange Bowl in one of the great games in NFL 
history, one that both teams seemed to have won several times. Both Dan Fouts 
and Miami's Don Strock passed for more than 400 yards. The Chargers had and 
blew a 24-0 lead. But for many, the indelible impression is tight end Kellen 
Winslow being carried off the field, exhausted from his heroic effort. 
Others considered: Game 4, 1984 NL Championship Series (Garvey's homer wins 
it). 
TOP COLLEGE EXECUTIVE 
Judy Sweet, UC San Diego athletic director: The UC San Diego athletic program 
flourished under Sweet, the first woman to become athletic director at a school 
that had a combined men's and women's program in 1975. But it wasn't until the 
'80s that the Tritons exploded on the NCAA Division III scene. UCSD teams won 
11 national titles in the '80s, finished second 14 times and third 12 times. 
During that span, UCSD had 300 All-Americans, 18 academic All-Americans and two 
NCAA post-graduate scholarship winners. While the Tritons were making their 
presence felt in Division III, Sweet was making an impact in the NCAA. She was 
vice president of Division III from 1986-88 and became the first women to be 
elected secretary-treasurer of the NCAA in 1989. 
TOP COLLEGE WOMEN'S COACH 
Doug Dannevik, UC San Diego volleyball: Recognition for Dannevik may have 
suffered because of the Pat Riley syndrome -- his teams were so good that 
people thought anybody could coach them. Of the nine NCAA Division III 
championships contested in the '80s, UCSD won five, finished second twice and 
lost in the regionals twice. His record for the '80s is 283-120 (70%). 
Others considered: Carol Plunkett (SDSU), tennis; Rudy Suwara (SDSU), 
volleyball. 
TOP COLLEGE FEMALE ATHLETE 
LaTanya Sheffield, San Diego State track: LaTanya Sheffield was not only the 
fastest 400-meter hurdler of the '80s in San Diego; for a while, she was the 
fastest in the country. Sheffield set an American record when she won the NCAA 
championships with a time of 54.64 in Austin, Tex., on May 31, 1985. She was a 
two-time All-American in the hurdles and the 400-meters and won Big West 
Conference titles in both events. She was also a member of the 1988 Olympic 
team. 
Others considered: Laura Mauritz (U.S. International), the only four-time NCAA 
Division I All-American in golf; Laura DeSnoo (SDSU), a three-time All-American 
in the discus and shot put; Vicki Cantrell (SDSU), a two-time All-American and 
Aztec career kill leader; Carol Lipsom (UC San Diego), an All-American at 
setter and outside hitter; Connie Navarro (Point Loma Nazarene), an NAIA 
All-American in volleyball and track. 
TOP COLLEGE MEN'S TEAM 
San Diego State baseball: San Diego State not only earned a reputation as one 
of the top programs in the country, it also became well known for producing 
top-caliber professionals. The Aztecs reached the NCAA tournament five times, 
including 1981-84, and compiled a record of 477-235-10 (.665). Some of the top 
individuals included Tony Gwynn, a four-time National League batting champion; 
Mark Grace of the Chicago Cubs; Bobby Meacham of the Texas Rangers, and Mark 
Williamson, the winning pitcher when Baltimore broke its 21-game losing streak 
to start the 1988 season. 
Others considered: UC San Diego swimming, one second-place finish and five 
third-place finishes in NCAA Division III championships. 
TOP COLLEGE WOMEN'S TEAM 
UC San Diego volleyball: When the NCAA began a Division III championship 
tournament in 1981, the Titans claimed it. They would go on to win four more 
(in 1984, '86, '87 and '88), finish second twice ('82 and '83) and end the '80s 
with a .702 (283-120) winning percentage, easily the best in the nation. 
Multiple All-Americans included Louise Schwartz (1981, '82 and '83), Tammy Smit 
('81, '82), Kristin Kilbourn ('83, '84), Molly Wheatley ('83, '84), Carol 
Lipson ('86, '87), Janet Hughes ('86, '87) and Diana Clintworth ('88, '89). 
Smith, Kilbourn and Wheatley were national players of the year. Lipson is the 
only two-time All-American at two positions. 
Others considered: SDSU volleyball. 
TOP COLLEGE MEN'S COACH 
Jim Dietz, San Diego State baseball: On record alone, Jim Dietz would qualify. 
In 10 seasons, he has led his team to five appearances in the National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. tournament, won two Western Athletic Conference 
titles and compiled a record of 477-235-10. But Dietz has also had success off 
the field. He has made the Aztec program a national contender through his own 
work to improve SDSU's Smith Field and his ability to raise funds for his team. 
Others considered: Chuck Clegg (SDSU), soccer. 
TOP COLLEGE MALE ATHLETES 
Michael Cage, San Diego State basketball: Cage might be best known to the rest 
of the country for his exploits in the National Basketball Assn. with the 
Clippers and Seattle SuperSonics, but to San Diego fans, he probably is best 
remembered as the leading scorer and rebounder in San Diego State history. He 
scored 1,846 points and grabbed 1,317 rebounds during a four-year career that 
ended in 1984. 
Todd Santos, San Diego State quarterback: Todd Santos came to San Diego State 
as a unheralded high school quarterback from the small central California town 
of Selma. He left as the most prolific major-college passer in National 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. history. He ended his career in 1987 with a total of 
11,425 yards passing and joined wide receiver Haven Moses as the only football 
players in SDSU history to have their numbers retired. 
Others considered: Chris Gywnn (SDSU), baseball; Kyle Whittemore (SDSU), 
soccer; Roger Axelsson (Point Loma Nazarene), nine-time NAIA All-American in 
discus, shot put and hammer. 
TOP COLLEGE MEN'S 1-YEAR TEAM 
1986 San Diego State football: The 1986 Aztec football team came out of nowhere 
under first-year Coach Denny Stolz to finish 8-4 and win the first Western 
Athletic Conference title in school history. Winning close games became the 
team's mark of success; seven victories were by seven points or fewer. That 
included a dramatic, 10-3 victory over Brigham Young in the last regular-season 
game to clinch the WAC title and a Holiday Bowl berth against Iowa. 
Others considered: 1984 SDSU baseball, 1987 SDSU soccer. 
TOP COLLEGE WOMEN'S 1-YEAR TEAM 
1981 San Diego State volleyball: The surprising Aztecs started three sophomores 
and were probably the best team in the country but they were not able to prove 
it because of a freak accident in the semifinals of the NCAA championships at 
UCLA. SDSU, which defeated UCLA twice during the regular season, led 1-0 when a 
UCLA player fell, rolled under the net and over middle blocker Toni Himmer's 
knee. Himmer did not return, and the young Aztecs could not recover mentally 
and lost, 3-1. SDSU routed Pacific for third place. The team featured five 
future All-Americans and five eventual national team members. 
Others considered: 1983-84 SDSU women's basketball, 1986 UC San Diego 
volleyball. 
TOP COLLEGE GAME 
1986 Holiday Bowl, San Diego State vs. Iowa: The 1986 Holiday Bowl game between 
San Diego State and Iowa featured another one of those down-to-the-wire 
finishes that have made the bowl traditionally one of the most exciting of the 
year. But this one was special because for the first time, the home-town Aztecs 
were involved. It came down to the end as the teams exchanged field goals in 
the final 47 seconds, with the Hawkeyes winning on a 41-yarder with four 
seconds to play. 
Others considered: 1984 SDSU baseball NCAA loss to Cal State Fullerton, 8-7, in 
11 innings in West I Regional Finals; 1987 SDSU NCAA semifinal victory over 
Harvard, 2-1, in shootout. 
TOP HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' COACH Wayne Branstetter, Poway wrestling: When one speaks 
of high school wrestling, the words Poway and Branstetter immediately follow. A 
tie against Vista in 1982 is the only flaw in Branstetter's 95-0-1 record since 
he became the Titans' coach in 1978. Branstetter's teams have dominated county 
wrestling, winning the section 3-A title on the mat every year since 1982, when 
3-A competition began. (The Titans had to forfeit in 1986 because they used an 
ineligible wrestler.) That year Poway went on to win the state title and set a 
state record by taking its entire team to the tournament. Poway has won the 
Masters tournament seven of the past eight years. 
Others considered: Jim Arnaiz (Helix), football; Neville Saner (Poway), 
basketball; Glen Takahashi (Valhalla), wrestling; Steve Eisler (Mt. Carmel), 
swimming. 
TOP HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS' COACH 
Lee Trepanier, Point Loma basketball: In 13 years of directing the Pointers, 
Trepanier has compiled a staggering 314-47 record. Within the decade, he has 
produced four state championships, four Southern California Regional titles, 
two regional runners-up, five San Diego Section championships and has broken 
and begun enough records to start his own recording label. His talent pool has 
been considerable, but Trepanier got the most out of the best. Under three-time 
section player of the year (1985-87) Terri Mann, the Pointers were 122-1 from 
1984-87, and with the help of 1989 section co-player of the year Monica Filer, 
Point Loma went 124-6 from 1986-89. Gulp. 
Others considered: Kris Mallory (Serra), field hockey; Bill Bullock (San 
Pasqual), soccer; Mary Daniels (Santana), gymnastics; Vicki Eveleth (La Jolla), 
volleyball. 
TOP HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' ATHLETE 
Mark Gerardi, Valhalla wrestling: Mark Gerardi is not only one of the best 
wrestlers to come out of San Diego but one of the best from California. He is 
one of only three wrestlers to win three California titles and only the second 
wrestler to win four Masters titles. Gerardi won his state titles from 1985-88 
at 138, 145 and 154 pounds and was recognized as the county's wrestler of the 
year each time. While at Valhalla (1984-88), Gerardi compiled a 153-6 record 
and holds the state record for consecutive victories with 128. 
TOP HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS' ATHLETE 
Terri Mann, Point Loma basketball: Between 1983 and 1987, Mann led Point Loma 
High's girls basketball varsity to four state championships. Although 
journalists often over-use the term "led" when speaking of an individual and 
her contributions to a team, in this case it is the only word. In her four 
years with the Pointers, Mann established national records for career rebounds 
(2,256) and rebounds in a season (816). She ranks third in career points 
(3,188) and second in points in one season (1,174). She was also USA Today's 
Player of the Year in 1987 and the California Player of the Year in both 1986 
and 1987, as chosen by Cal-Hi Sports. 
TOP HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' TEAM 
Mt. Carmel baseball: Sam Blalock is the only coach the Mt. Carmel baseball 
program has ever had, and there's certainly no reason to go looking for anybody 
else. This decade, the Sundevils have reached six San Diego Section 3-A 
championship games and won four. They were champions in 1981 (beating Point 
Loma in the championship game, 1-0), 1982 (Helix, 10-9), 1987 (Santana, 7-2) 
and 1989 (Helix, 19-15). All this, and Mt. Carmel didn't have one section 
player of the year. Just plenty of talented players and some pretty good 
coaching. 
Others considered: Poway basketball, Vista football, Torrey Pines golf, La 
Jolla soccer, Mt. Carmel swimming, La Jolla tennis, Coronado water polo, Poway 
wrestling. 
TOP HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS' TEAM 
Serra field hockey: Just look into the county record books and gaze at the 
accomplishments of Serra over the past 10 years. Since 1980, Serra has won the 
section championship every year except 1986 and 1989. The Conquistadors have 
dominated the Western League, winning 104 consecutive matches from 1978-87. 
Serra has either won or been league co-champions 12 consecutive times 
('79-'89). During 1983-'86, Serra had a record winning streak of 86; it won 41 
in a row from 1981-83. The Conquistadors allowed just one goal to be scored 
against them in the 1980, '81 and '83 seasons. 
Others considered: Point Loma basketball, La Jolla and Bishop's tennis. 
TOP HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' 1-YEAR TEAM 
1985 Vista football: Led by All-County quarterback Sal Aunese, the Panthers 
(13-0) defeated their opponents by at least 21 points in 12 of 13 victories. 
Aunese gained 136 yards in 12 carries in the 3-A championship game, a 35-7 
victory over Helix. He also completed two of six passes for 68 yards and a 
touchdown. Aunese, the Palomar League's offensive player of the year, rushed 
for 936 yards and 13 touchdowns and passed for more than 600 during the year. 
He also returned three punts for touchdowns. Aunese went on to lead Colorado 
University to a Freedom Bowl Appearance three years later. In September of 
1989, Aunese died of cancer at the age of 21. Tailback Roger Price, defensive 
lineman Albert Sega and defensive back Tommy Booker were named to The Times' 
All-County team. 
Other's considered: Mt. Carmel baseball (1987), Rancho Buena Vista football 
(1988), Poway basketball (1986). 
TOP HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS' 1-YEAR TEAM 
1987 Point Loma basketball: All-American Terri Mann finished her spectacular 
career by leading the Pointers (34-0) to a fourth consecutive state 
championship. Mann scored 30 points and grabbed 25 rebounds in Point Loma's 
60-44 victory in the state championship game over Grant of Sacramento. 
Others considered: Point Loma's teams in 1984, 1985 and 1986.
