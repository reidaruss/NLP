A youngish TV reporter settled himself opposite Shirley Temple Black in the 
parlor of Tournament House in Pasadena, where she was sailing cheerily through 
a morning of obligatory interviews, and suggested for openers, that, good 
grief, she'd been around forever and now she was grand marshal of the Rose 
Parade for the second time, after Fifty years and. . . . 
To which Black, who is now 60, replied, enjoying her own joke, "Yes, I'm one of 
the oldest living Americans." 
An American icon at an age when most Americans aren't yet collecting Social 
Security checks, Black is not one to dwell in the past. As she puts it, 
"Looking over my shoulder is not my style." 
In the 1930s, she was the dimpled charmer who lifted Depression-era spirits and 
sat on the laps of so many world leaders that, she later observed, "It's a 
wonder I ever learned to walk." 
Today, she is more apt to be talking about peace, help for the homeless and the 
hungry, preservation of the environment, halting the AIDS epidemic. 
A Nippy, Overcast Day 
But on this particular morning, two days before today's centennial Rose Parade, 
Black was happy to reminisce: It was Jan. 2, 1939, and the adorable 10-year-old 
moppet, wearing a white ermine coat with matching muff, a white hat atop her 
perfect curls, was riding as grand marshal at the head of the 50th Rose Parade. 
She recalled: "The float I was on was spectacular, covered with roses" (2,500, 
shading from red to pink) with a dais of gardenias, "my favorite flower." The 
day was nippy and overcast -- rain would hold off until the parade had ended -- 
but, Black said, "there was a little heater at my feet, covered with flowers. 
It was cozy and warm and everything smelled beautiful. 
"I waved diligently for about 2 1/2 hours," she added, noting she learned to 
cover the record crowd of 1.2 million along the route by adopting the "Queen of 
England" technique, tracing a slow, sweeping arc with one arm. "You can get a 
whole lot of people that way. And I love all people. There are some I don't 
like, but I love all people." 
She also "loved the horses and the beautiful saddles and all the silver." 
(Three years earlier, she had been given her first horse, a Shetland pony she 
named Spunky.) 
And she "loved" being the grand marshal and wearing a big badge with a rosette 
even though, prodded now for more details, she summarized it like the pro she 
always was: "It was dark. I was taken to the float and put on it. And I did my 
job. My car, or truck, or whatever it was under all those flowers, didn't break 
down." 
Her parents had insisted on security precautions, and safe she was, with Leo 
Carrillo, "one of my best friends," riding his horse close by. He gave her a 
Western outfit, chaps and all, and, she says, "I still have it." Clopping along 
right behind her float was Los Angeles Sheriff Eugene Biscaluiz with his 
mounted posse. 
It was, by all reports, a spectacular parade -- 5 miles long, with 65 floats 
and 18 bands, a spectacle of such proportions that one journalist was moved to 
write, "The 1939 Tournament of Roses probably never will be excelled." 
The flower-decked floats had drawn gasps from spectators. Santa Barbara had 
entered a Taj Mahal; Laguna Beach had recreated Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last 
Supper." Camp Baldy's entry had depicted Whistler's Mother. Burbank had rolled 
off with the sweepstakes for its tally-ho pulled by four prancing snow-white 
floral steeds. 
She Likes to Steer 
But what was Shirley Temple thinking as she rode at the head of that parade? 
Well, she recalls, "I knew I was part of a very important tradition." Then she 
added, "And I would have preferred to steer. I like to steer everything, 
trains, boats. . . ." 
And, as she had earlier told the crowd at Pasadena Kiwanis Club's 1989 kick-off 
luncheon, being grand marshal "has a few disadvantages. It is no job for 
someone who likes to march. I really loved to march." 
Besides, she observed, "You don't get to see the parade, all that happens back 
there." 
Having said all that, she was, Black emphasized, "thrilled" when 1989 
Tournament of Roses President John H. Biggar III came calling at the Blacks' 
home in Woodside in Northern California with an invitation to be grand marshal 
once again. Her answer, she said, was an "instant yes." 
When Lathrop K. Leishman, tournament president in 1939, was looking for a grand 
marshal, he recalls in "Tournament of Roses: The First 100 Years," a centennial 
history, "There was no name in America as big as Shirley Temple. . . . I 
decided she should be our grand marshal -- if we could get her." 
They got her, thus scoring the coup of having as grand marshal the child star 
who had been No. 1 at the box office for four straight years, topping such 
superstars as Clark Gable and Robert Taylor. 
And as Biggar noted at this year's kickoff luncheon, the theme for today's 
parade is "Celebration 100" and the committee wanted a grand marshal who would 
"express the tradition" of the parade. It also sought "a celebration-type 
person, cheerful, uplifting." 
Reenter, Shirley Temple Black. 
'Purple Power Suit' 
But this is 1989, and this time around the grand marshal won't be wearing 
ermine. 
"The (anti-) fur people wouldn't like it," she says. Instead, she has opted to 
wear what she calls her "purple power suit," bought on her recent 21-city tour 
to promote her autobiography, when she discovered that her 
black-and-white-checked number was dizzying on TV. 
And, riding beside her, at Black's request, will be her only grandchild, Teresa 
Falaschi, an 8-year-old who has promised her "Nana" that she will sit suitably 
still. 
"Teresa said to me, 'Do I have to ride in the buggy? I'd rather do gymnastics 
all the way.' " Black noted. "She's very energetic." 
Feels Like Child Again 
Two horses will pull the grand marshal's surrey -- a conveyance about which 
Temple said, "I guess it befits my age" -- and, as it will seat three, she 
hoped to have her daughter, Susan Falaschi, 40, ride along. Black's husband, 
businessman Charles Black, will be in the stands. 
It is not hard to believe Black when she says she feels once again like "a 
child of 10, wide-eyed with honor." She plunged into pre-parade festivities and 
duties with contagious enthusiasm, answering repetitive media questions with 
grace and humor, tossing one-liners, occasionally slipping in a word for her 
book, "Child Star." 
She is eager to know how the book reads, mentioning that author Wallace 
Stegner, a friend and neighbor, got her on track, telling her she needed a 
story line to tie together her anecdotes and insisting that she "get rid of the 
dangling participles." 
One of those charming anecdotes is about New Year's Eve, 1938, when Shirley and 
a girlfriend, who was spending the night, were whisked off to bed early so 
Shirley would be rested for her role as grand marshal. 
Watched Horror Thriller 
But the girls were determined to crash her parents' anniversary party, in 
progress below. On their third try, they managed to thwart a photoelectric beam 
that protected Shirley's bedroom at the Brentwood home from intruders. 
Creeping down the circular staircase, they peered into the darkened living room 
where guests were watching "Night Must Fall," a horror thriller starring Robert 
Montgomery. 
In the film, "They were carrying somebody's head around in a hatbox," she 
recalls, adding that she promptly had nightmares about a body-less head. She 
laughs and says, "I had all of New Year's Day to recover." 
"Child Star" is no sordid Hollywood tell-all, though Black does write candidly 
about the breakup of her 1945 marriage to John Agar, describing him as a 
drinker and a womanizer. 
She also sets the record straight on her wealth: All but $44,000 of the $3.4 
million she earned has disappeared, largely as a result of mishandling by her 
father, George, who died in 1980. 
But, she is quick to say now, she does not blame him. He was, she says, a man 
of limited education, "an innocent led to slaughter" by advisers. No, she has 
"no regrets" about the lost millions. 
Unlike other celebrities, Black did not want to write about what she describes 
as "all that psychological stuff -- who am I? Where am I going?" 
Well-Adjusted Woman 
She laughs and says, "I started so young, I didn't have to ask." (At age 3, 
little Shirley was plucked from a Santa Monica dancing school and cast in a 
series of low-budget one -- reelers called "Baby Burlesks.") Black now refers 
to this as her "starlet" period, before being signed by Fox at age 5. 
What is perhaps most astonishing about Shirley Temple Black is that she matured 
into such a well-adjusted, focused woman. This, after all, was the child who 
taught fractions to Noel Coward, played croquet with Orson Welles, handed out 
Oscars to Disney's seven dwarfs, the child whose doll look-alikes added up to 
$45 million in sales for Ideal Toy and Novelty Co. of New York by 1941. 
How did she do it? "I had a super mother," she says. "She kept my head on 
straight." (Gertrude Temple also rolled every one of Shirley's 56 famous 
sausage curls each day and, with two secretaries, answered her fan mail.) 
Mother Temple "just dusted off" the adulation, Black said, always explaining to 
her daughter that what people admired was her work. Shirley never saw the fan 
letters. And, each day when she left the Fox lot, she remembers, "I'd get off 
the little frilly dress," pull on jeans "and climb trees" or play cops 'n' 
robbers with the neighborhood boys. 
Ran Before Horses 
A self-described "tomboy" and "jock," Black was never more thrilled than during 
the filming of "Wee Willie Winkie," (1937) when, eschewing a double, she ran 
before a herd of stampeding horses. John Ford was the director, she says, and 
"he liked to direct men." But from then on, she added, "he started treating me 
as a macho kid." 
She lists that film as one of two favorites among all those she made from her 
first in 1931 to her last in 1949, chiefly "because I got to march so much." 
Her second favorite was "The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer" (1947), largely 
because "Cary Grant was just super to work with." 
Watching Black in action -- a poised, outgoing woman in a happy second marriage 
of 38 years, with three grown children, a woman who refers to herself as "a 
good wife, that's No. 1," an observer can't help but make comparisons to 
today's young stars, many of whom are plagued by alcohol and drug problems and 
lifelong conflicts. 
Asked about 1939 Hollywood, she reflected on it as "a time of innocence." 
Reporters did not probe celebrities' private lives, she says, and "everybody 
was idolized." She looks back on "an enchanted childhood." 
She pauses before another interview at Tournament House and checks to see if 
she has remembered to remove the price tag from the new, long white sweater 
with a pattern of stylized red roses that she is wearing over a black leather 
skirt. 
Practicing Spanish Phrase 
Those are apt to be the only red roses she'll get very close to. Yes, she is 
allergic to them, "not the pink ones," just the red ones. Next, for an 
interview with a Spanish language station, she is practicing, in Spanish, how 
to say "Happy New Year." 
To a radio reporter from Michigan, she expresses her disappointment that her 
book tour did not take her to Detroit -- "I've never been to Detroit." 
In another interview, she demurs on a question about whether she prefers 
Northern California to Southern California, where she was born, saying, "I like 
the whole state." 
Will she be rooting for USC or Michigan when she tosses the coin for the team 
captains before today's game? "I'm a diplomat. However, I was born in 
California. . . ." 
Ambassador to Ghana 
Black is a professional diplomat, having been during 19 years of government 
service U.S. ambassador to the West African nation of Ghana, a stint she looks 
back on as "the best job of my whole life," as well as a U.S. delegate to the 
United Nations and U.S. chief of protocol, the first woman to hold that job. 
One interviewer refers to her years as an "ambassadress" and she gently 
corrects him, explaining she was "an ambassador. Ambassadress is what you 
wear." 
Soon, she is fielding another question about her, well, normalcy. "Life has 
been very fair to me," she says. "I've had a very fulfilling life." Yes, there 
have been "some bad times, some sad times," including breast cancer surgery in 
1972, a personal crisis she shared with the world in hopes of encouraging other 
women to have checkups. 
People come and go, the room filling with pleasant, low-key banter. Someone 
makes a good-natured reference to her as "The Little Colonel," one of her 
famous film roles, and Black shoots back, "I'm a general now, and a grand 
marshal. Watch it." 
Lost Congressional Race 
Then she is talking sports with ABC's Tim McCarver, telling him she's "a good 
shot" (targets only). 
"I don't hunt quail," she says later, "but I love Bush." (A lifelong 
Republican, Black ran for Congress in 1967, losing in the primary to Paul 
McCloskey Jr. She was a first-time delegate this year to the GOP National 
Convention.) 
Suddenly, someone asks what if -- what if it rains today on her parade. It 
won't, she replies. "As an ambassador, nothing perturbs you. If it rains, I'll 
get wet. You'll never know it."
