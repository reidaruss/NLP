Johnny Carson and David Letterman made it. But not Alan Thicke, Joan Rivers, 
Paul Robins and Phil Cowan, et al. The late-night TV arena and trivia books are 
littered with the bodies of Carson challengers, but that hasn't stopped Pat 
Sajak and Arsenio Hall. This month they plunge into the highly competitive time 
slot after the 11 o'clock news. (Answer to trivia question No. 1: Robins and 
Cowan hosted the late "The Wilton North Report" on Fox Broadcasting.) 
Both Sajak, congenial host of "Wheel of Fortune," America's favorite game show, 
and Hall, who broke into late night last year as a guest host on Fox's 
now-defunct "Late Show," plan to avoid direct competition with the mighty 
Carson "Tonight Show." Both say they'll try to provide something completely 
different. 
Marla Kell Brown, producer of "The Arsenio Hall Show" points out that 
competition in late-night television is somewhat different from that during 
other "dayparts," as the networks dub the different time periods. 
In prime time, for example, the competition is the other networks. In late 
night, "your biggest competition is sleep," said Brown, who worked with Hall 
during his "Late Show" stint after Joan Rivers' ouster. 
Sajak, who makes his CBS late-night debut next Monday at 11:30 p.m. with the 
appropriately titled "Pat Sajak Show," and Hall, whose syndicated "Arsenio Hall 
Show" premieres Tuesday at 11 p.m. on KCOP Channel 13 in Los Angeles, say they 
don't plan to unseat NBC's Carson and Letterman, ABC's "Nightline" or even go 
head-to-head with each other. 
They just want to find their own audience among the available pool of 
late-night viewers and keep them from falling asleep over their bedtime snacks. 
"We're not going to worry about Arsenio; we're not going to worry about Carson 
and 'Nightline,' either. We just have to do what feels best for Pat," insisted 
Sajak producer Paul Gilbert in a recent conversation at CBS, where the network 
spent between $4 million and $5 million constructing a new sound stage and 
other facilities for "The Pat Sajak Show," the network's first late-night 
effort since 1972, when it canceled Merv Griffin's show. 
Ask the people behind "The Arsenio Hall Show" whether they're drawing up battle 
plans and they give the same answer. "Hopefully there's enough room for 
everybody," said Frank Kelly, senior vice president of programming at Paramount 
Television, where the show is produced. 
Said Hall: "I think people place too much emphasis on the competition; I'm 
running my own race. It's a personal best, it's me against me. I'm on after 
Sajak in Chicago (the show airs at various times in different cities) so I want 
him to do well." 
Well, maybe there's just a little competitive sentiment. "The demographic that 
knows Sajak from daytime TV is people who should be asleep (at 11:30). His 
people are asleep," Hall noted smugly in an interview at his office at 
Paramount. "He probably would do well with a morning talk show. That's what I 
would have done with him if I were a CBS executive." 
The Carson camp refused comment on their new competitors. But Robert Morton, 
producer of "Late Night With David Letterman," said there's truth in the notion 
that dissimilar late-night shows pose little threat to one another. 
"I think we'd be crazy not to care that they're out there," Morton said. "(But) 
there are some shows that, when they're faced with severe competition, are in 
an out-and-out battle -- witness the morning shows, how many different ones CBS 
has tried. I don't think it's that intense with the late-night shows. 
"In fact, we've had Pat Sajak on 'Letterman,' talking about 'The Pat Sajak 
Show,' There is, of course, a competitive spirit. But on the other hand, I 
think he'll bring another audience to late night -- his daytime viewers. That 
can only be helpful to late night. (If) they like his show, maybe they'll turn 
to our show." 
Unlike Sajak, however, Hall has not been a guest on "Letterman." "I was booked 
(on the show), and then, the day of the announcement that I was going to have 
my own show, they canceled me," Hall said. "At first I wasn't upset about it, 
because this is war. Then I heard that Sajak was on the show. Maybe they don't 
consider Sajak competition . . . ." 
Producer Morton denies playing favorites. "We don't care about competing shows 
as far as booking -- we have guests from the other networks all the time," he 
said huffily. He acknowledged, however, that Hall was originally booked for one 
"Letterman" date, which Hall himself canceled because he had a schedule 
conflict. The only other date Hall had available was nixed because it fell too 
close to the debut date of "The Arsenio Hall Show." "We just thought it would 
looked a little strange to have him one place, and then another right away," 
Morton countered. 
Whether or not Hall and Sajak are deliberately competing -- or which one gets 
an on-air audience with David Letterman -- the pair have definitely assigned 
themselves a difficult task: trying to be different from each other and the 
rest of the pack without really breaking any of the comfortable late-night 
conventions that have made Jack Paar, Carson, Letterman and others bright stars 
long after the moon comes up over Television Land. 
And now, he-e-e-re's Pat and Arsenio. . . . Host: Pat Sajak. (Caucasian male, 
42, "Wheel of Fortune" host. Weatherman for Los Angeles' KNBC-TV 1977-81 and 
prior to that at WSMV-TV in Nashville.) 
Network: CBS. 
Time: 11:30 p.m. Running Time: 90 minutes. 
Sidekick: Yes (Dan Miller, former news anchor and Sajak colleague in Nashville; 
briefly held an anchor position at Los Angeles' KCBS-TV in 1986, but was fired 
following a messy management coup at the station). 
Studio Orchestra: Yes (The Tom Scott Band, all-male, jazz-rock-fusion). 
Desk for the host: Yes. 
Style: Neo-Jack Paar. Broad demographic appeal. Guests ranging from show-biz 
superstars to political figures, authors, scientists and the man- or 
woman-in-the-street. Sajak, who worshiped Paar as pre-Carson host of "The 
Tonight Show" while a child growing up in Chicago, hopes to bring back the good 
old days of late-night talk -- when guests were entertaining, conversation was 
gracious and nobody ever broke the host's nose by throwing a chair at him. 
At first, the producers of the "Pat Sajak Show" considered a radical move: 
Instead of seating guests on the left side of Sajak's desk -- the way Johnny 
Carson does on "The Tonight Show" -- Sajak's people wanted to put guests on the 
right side, just to make things a little different. 
They decided against it. "I swear, it was like looking into a mirror, we're so 
used to seeing it the other way," said Sajak. "It just looked weird." 
Weird is the last thing "The Pat Sajak Show" wants to be. It enters late-night 
TV with the philosophy that the traditional talk-show format is not broken and 
needs no fixing. 
Although the show's producers seek to minimize Sajak's identification with 
"Wheel of Fortune," the new Pat Sajak will basically be the old Pat Sajak. 
Coordinating producer David Williger said any image changes will be subtle, if 
detectable. Sajak usually wears double-breasted suitcoats and a pocket 
handkerchief on "Wheel." On "Sajak," he will wear mostly single-breasted coats 
sans handkerchief. 
Mike Mischler, CBS vice president of advertising promotions, described the 
show's promotional campaign as equally low-key to avoid what he calls 
"anticipointment" -- or unrealistic viewer expectations. "The problem with that 
is, they watch the first night and they never come back again," he said. 
"That's why 'Thicke of the Night' failed; they trumpeted the Second Coming, and 
there was no Second Coming." 
Sajak considered the idea of having no sidekick. He considered the idea of 
having a woman sidekick -- but after years on "Wheel" opposite Vanna White, 
decided that viewers might find another woman disconcerting, "as though Vanna 
and I had gotten a divorce or something" (although Sajak will be replaced on 
the daytime "Wheel of Fortune" by ex-football star Rolf Benirschke, he will 
continue to host the night-time show). 
Sajak also thought the good-natured ribbing between male host and female 
sidekick might be misconstrued: "If I'm needling some guy, it's two guys having 
fun -- but if I'm needling a woman, I'm a cad, and if she's needling me, she's 
a bitch," Sajak said. Eventually he settled on old friend Dan Miller, a 
quintessential authoritative newscaster whose towering height and rich 
Nashville-tinged voice provides vivid contrast to Sajak's elfin charm and quick 
wit. 
Sajak said the show will make ample use of CBS' location in the Fairfax 
district, conducting live interviews from the studio via microwave link-ups 
with the locals, from melon merchants at Farmer's Market to the punks of 
Melrose Avenue. The producers have purchased a helicopter to pay impromptu 
visits to earthquake sites and other areas of note. Sajak plans to do for CBS 
Television City what Carson did for beautiful downtown Burbank. And Steve Allen 
once did for Hollywood. 
Although "Sajak" producers eventually hope to develop their own signature bits 
along the lines of Letterman's "Stupid Pet Tricks," Sajak plans to keep his 
show traditional -- even returning to the 90-minute format earlier used by Paar 
and Carson to allow guests enough time to develop a conversation. 
"I was at Jack Paar's house a couple of weeks ago, and we watched some of his 
old shows," Sajak said. "You can't do it quite the same way anymore -- things 
have changed, attention spans have shortened. But you can get a little of that 
flavor. The one thing we did not do was say, 'What can we do to break new 
ground, what can we do to be radical?' This format has been working in one form 
or another for 35 years." Host: Arsenio Hall. (Black male, 30, most popular 
guest host of Fox Broadcasting's "Late Show Starring Joan Rivers" following 
Rivers' ouster. Turned down regular hosting position on "Late Show" to pursue 
movie career; most recently starred with best friend Eddie Murphy in the 
box-office hit "Coming to America.") 
Network: Syndicated. 
Time: In Los Angeles, 11 p.m. on KCOP Channel 13. 
Running Time: 60 minutes. 
Sidekick: No. 
Studio Orchestra: Yes (Hall describes the band as unusual because it features 
women: "I have a sexy lady on drums, I have a sexy lady on keyboard" . . . ). 
Desk: Absolutely not. 
Style: Hall plans to create the hipness of Letterman without his hard-edged 
cynicism. Hall describes himself as just a star-struck boy from Cleveland 
beneath all the Hollywood glitter. Although guests will be wide-ranging, as on 
"Sajak," Hall expects his show to have a slightly younger demographic appeal 
due to his own freewheeling, desk-less approach to interviewing. Hall boldly 
calls himself "The Martin Luther King of comedy," and plans to eliminate racism 
and sexism from late-night TV by making sure minorities and women appear on the 
show. "There are a lot of people out there who don't have a talk show. I am 
their talk show." 
Hall will make two concessions to late-night TV tradition: (a) he will call his 
show "The Arsenio Hall Show," and (b) the announcer will be male. Paramount 
audience research showed that people did not find a female announcer's voice 
"authoritative" enough. 
And the title? It just seemed to fit. "We had guys here (at Paramount) who make 
$300,000 a year saying: 'How about "The Arsenio Hall Show?" ' " Hall said with 
a chuckle. "But 'Arsenio Hall After Dark' sounded sleazy. And I thought of 
'Arsenio,' " but they said: 'You're not Cher, pal." 
Beyond that, Hall plans to shake up the format. Talking to his guests without 
the barrier of a desk, Hall said he will try for spontaneity with both guests 
and audience. "I just like to wing it," he said in a conversation at his 
ultra-modern Paramount office, with a big-screen music video throbbing in the 
background. "I'm a comedian, I come from the clubs. I know how to work an 
audience." 
Despite his youthful following, Hall will eschew leather jackets and jeans for 
stylish suits and a more sophisticated look to broaden his audience. Nor does 
he plan to limit his guest list to youth-appeal acts. "I'd love to talk to 
Ronald Reagan," he offered. "There isn't anyone who I would consider too old 
and square. I'd love to do Bette Davis, I'd love to talk to Wayne Newton." 
Producer Brown noted that publicists for some of Hollywood's less-than-hip 
stars have begun seeking out the show because they believe Hall can bring out 
"a lighter side to the client" than other hosts. 
Meanwhile, as both host and producer will tell you, Arsenio will do nothing but 
concentrate on being Arsenio. "I honestly think Joan's (Rivers) failure was 
based on the fact that they tried to change Joan, they tried to tone her down," 
Hall said. "I have to be Arsenio. I'm the best Arsenio there is." 
"Sajak" head writer Monty Aidem believes that Sajak and Hall, both nice guys 
from the Midwest, have just the right non-abrasive quality and ability to draw 
out other people -- rather than simply go for a joke -- that makes viewers want 
to welcome them into their homes on a nightly basis. 
"All of the very successful talk-show hosts are Midwestern people, just like 
Pat," mused Aidem, veteran of "The Tonight Show," "Thicke of The Night," and 
Fox's "Late Show Starring Joan Rivers." "That includes Johnny Carson and David 
Letterman, and, gee, Dick Cavett, too. 
"Those people wear well, you don't get tired of them quickly. It's a real solid 
base to come from."
