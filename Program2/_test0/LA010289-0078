Blessed by a harbor, beaches and world-class hotels, all that Dana Point needed 
was a sense of community to tie it all together. 
As of Sunday, Dana Point lacked for nothing as it officially became the 
county's 28th city. 
During a brief ceremony aboard a replica of the brig Pilgrim (the first Pilgrim 
carried 19th-Century author and city namesake Richard Henry Dana Jr. to what he 
would later call "the only romantic spot in California") Dana Point's 
five-member City Council was sworn in Sunday. 
In one of the council's first official acts, Councilwoman Judy Curreri was 
voted temporary mayor by her colleagues. 
A cannon blast -- actually, a 12-gauge shotgun blank -- marked the birth of the 
municipality as 100 people aboard the square-rigged Pilgrim winced at the roar. 
A fire engine-red Orange County Sheriff's Harbor Patrol boat chugged up the 
Dana Point Harbor channel toward the ship moored at Dana Cove Park, its sirens 
wailing and five jets of water spraying high. 
"I think it'll be a great coastal city," said Ingrid McGuire, newly sworn in as 
the city's temporary mayor pro-tem. "I think it's a marvelous omen today that 
the sun is shining. Even the elements are smiling on Dana Point." 
Now, the city will get down to the giddy business of collecting millions of 
dollars in hotel bed-tax revenue and making sure that its 26,000 residents have 
enough essential services. A consultant has determined that the city's 
first-year revenue would be about $9 million -- $2 million more than needed to 
provide services at the level they are now under county auspices. 
The new council will have some nettlesome problems in governing a community so 
diverse that transient day laborers sleep in fields within view of $250-a-night 
hotel rooms. But nearly everyone in Dana Point is optimistic, given that it is 
entering cityhood as one of the more prosperous new municipalities in 
California. 
"I see this as probably the greatest city in the United States," Lynn Dawson, a 
member of the Dana Point Task Force for Incorporation, said last week. "We've 
got harbors, hotels, beaches and sun nearly every day of the year. I mean, what 
else can you want?" 
On Sunday, council members Bill Bamattre, Mike Eggers, Eileen Krause, Curreri 
and McGuire conducted their first act of business by adopting a 2-inch-thick 
set of county ordinances and regulations -- a routine procedure until the city 
adopts its own laws. 
Standing on the Pilgrim II's deck with hands raised, the council members were 
sworn in by County Clerk Gary L. Granville. Newspaperman Dana sailed on the 
original brig Pilgrim in 1834-36 and published "Two Years Before the Mast," 
based on those experiences, in 1840. 
The council will select a mayor and mayor pro-tem Wednesday and participate in 
a ceremonial inauguration at the Dana Point Resort. Fifth District County 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley is to administer the oath of office. The public is 
invited to the free event, at which hors d'oeuvres will be offered. 
The council will eventually have to adopt a general plan and hire a city staff. 
For now, the city has hired former Anaheim City Manager William O. Talley as 
its city manager and former Rep. Jerry M. Patterson (D-Garden Grove) as its 
city attorney. 
The city hall now consists of a trailer at the construction site of an office 
building, where the city has leased space. The city plans to build a civic 
center within 3 years. 
"I don't know that I'm nervous," Curreri said last week. "But I am excited and 
glad that we're finally at the point that we can take action." 
Getting there has been a long and troublesome journey for Dana Point. 
Citizens who first tried to incorporate in 1961 couldn't even get enough 
signatures on their petitions to qualify for a hearing before the County Board 
of Supervisors, according to Dana Point historian Doris Walker. 
Twice more during the next decade, residents tried to incorporate but were 
turned down by the county for, among other things, not having a strong enough 
economic base, Walker said. During that period, Dana Point was little more than 
a sleepy backwater, halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego. 
But by the 1980s, the Dana Point Harbor had been built for yachts, the 
Ritz-Carlton and Dana Point Resort hotels had opened and the community was 
beginning to rival other county coastal cities for the lucrative tourist trade. 
In the spring of 1987, Dana Point decided to try again for cityhood. Curreri 
lead a group of residents to the County Local Agency Formation Commission with 
a plan to incorporate just a 3-square-mile area known as Old Dana Point. 
LAFCO later added 1.5-mile-square Capistrano Beach and -- in a move that 
outraged adjoining Laguna Niguel -- a 1.5-mile-square coastal strip that 
includes the 393-room Ritz-Carlton and the planned 1,126-room Monarch Beach 
resort. The two resorts are expected to account for nearly $10 million in hotel 
bed taxes -- a major reason Laguna Niguel laid claim to the same strip. 
Laguna Niguel's claim, however, has been rejected by both the county and by a 
Superior Court judge. Laguna Niguel is appealing further. 
With Dana Point's incorporation boundaries finally set, an election was held 
June 7 in which three-quarters of voters approved cityhood. 
The cityhood outcome pleased nearly everyone in the community, as it finally 
freed residents from having to deal with county bureaucrats in faraway Santa 
Ana for such matters as street improvements. 
"The reason people wanted cityhood was to have accessibility to the 
decision-makers," Curreri said. 
Stan Cummings, director of the Orange County Marine Institute at Dana Cove 
Park, said the incorporation finally gives him the sense of identity that he 
had while growing up in a close-knit New England town. 
"I really feel that we now have a city which controls a certain amount of its 
own destiny," said Cummings, who will be master of ceremonies for Wednesday's 
inauguration festivities. "The people running it will be people you see on the 
street every day and who are friends and neighbors." 
The self-governing process actually began before Sunday. 
Traffic, Parking, Renewal 
Dana Point's City Council-elect met on several occasions in recent months to 
hear what residents want from their new city. They have cited traffic 
congestion, parking shortages and the need to upgrade older areas. 
It will take time for the city to organize, but Eggers and some other council 
members believe they can alleviate traffic congestion quickly. 
One major bottleneck, Eggers said, is at the intersection of Coast Highway and 
Del Obispo Street, where afternoon commute traffic often backs up more than a 
mile. Eggers said the city may press the California Department of 
Transportation to widen Coast Highway by restriping the lanes. 
The city may also try to speed up the planned extension across San Juan Creek 
of Stonehill Drive, Eggers added, which would give motorists a second artery 
for getting to Old Dana Point from Capistrano Beach. That extension project is 
financed jointly by state and local agencies, so he said the city can help 
facilitate the work by making sure its share of the money is allocated swiftly. 
Conversely, some merchants are concerned that a recent rerouting of Coast 
Highway traffic so one-way northbound and southbound lanes are separated by a 
large chunk of the city's main business district causes traffic to whiz by too 
fast for many potential customers to safely stop, Curreri said. She wants the 
city to install lights on both one-way corridors to slow traffic down. 
The city will also need to spend untold money repairing and maintaining roads 
in older parts of the city, City Manager Talley said. 
One of his first orders of business will be to study which roads need 
attention, Talley said. 
Eggers said the council will get involved in Dana Point's economic development. 
"You can't have a healthy city if you don't have a healthy business community," 
he said. 
Eggers would like the city to establish an economic development committee to 
take a long-term look at the city's business needs. 
Tourist Orientation Shunned 
One thing Dana Point wants to avoid, he said, is seeing its business district 
taken over by tourist-oriented "yogurt shops and novelty items," as he said has 
happened in Laguna Beach. 
Instead, he said, the city needs to bill itself as a "destination resort" that 
will not only have businesses catering to tourists but also to residents. 
Ed Conway, a local Realtor and past president of the Dana Point Chamber of 
Commerce, said business is growing in the city. Membership in the local Chamber 
of Commerce, he said, grew from 400 in 1986 to 600 in 1988. Conway added that a 
2-year boom in local real estate has pushed property values to unprecedented 
levels. A three-bedroom home worth $150,000 in 1986 now fetches up to $300,000. 
But the economic picture is not so bright for everybody in the new city. 
In Capistrano Beach, for example, transients are known to be camping under 
bridges and in fields, while Latino laborers congregate in large numbers along 
Doheny Park Road in search of temporary work. Capistrano Beach merchants have 
complained about the laborers, as well as about run-down housing along Doheny 
Park Road. 
Big Contrasts in 3 Areas 
With pockets of poverty on one side of town and fabulous wealth on another -- 
homes in the Monarch Beach coastal strip on the north side of the city run into 
the millions of dollars -- the Dana Point council will face a challenge in 
meeting the needs of all residents. 
But the council may be ill-equipped to do that, as two of the council members 
live in the Monarch Beach strip and the other three live in Old Dana Point, 
said Peg Maynard, leader of a citizens' watchdog group calling itself the 
Coastal Organization Group. 
There is no one, she said, to watch out for the interests of Capistrano Beach, 
where 7,000 city residents live. 
Maynard, who along with many other members of the group ran unsuccessfully for 
the Dana Point council, said the city should have its council members elected 
by district to ensure fair representation. 
But Curreri argued that districting "tends to narrow people's focus and tends 
to encourage political deal-making. I would rather have five people concerned 
equally about the whole area."
