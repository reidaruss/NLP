It was a decade in which Laura Bradbury disappeared from a stark desert 
campsite, a small boy survived an inferno set by his father, the county got its 
first billionaire, septuplets were born, mountain lions attacked children and 
an animal shelter was chosen to house the homeless. Winnie the Pooh went on 
trial, Richard M. Nixon went to New York, Anaheim went up in smoke, the 
Olympics came and went, and the price of a house went through the roof. Here's 
a closer look at some of the events that made headlines in Orange County in the 
1980s: 
1983: The year of the Decade 
TRAGIC MISTAKE: 
Stanton Police Officer Anthony Sperl, called to an apartment because neighbors 
had not seen the family for days, went in to investigate. Startled by a dim 
figure brandishing a handgun, Sperl fired and killed Patrick Ridge, 5, who had 
been left home alone by his working mother. Patrick had been holding a toy 
revolver. 
TRAGIC INTENTIONS: 
Charles Rothenberg, a waiter on vacation from New York, checked into a Buena 
Park motel room, put his 6-year-old son David to bed, doused the room with 
kerosene, then set it ablaze and fled. David survived but was horribly burned 
and faced years of plastic surgery and pain. His father, begging forgiveness at 
his trial, was sentenced to 13 years in prison and is due for parole in 
January. 
CAUGHT AT LAST: 
Two California Highway Patrol officers routinely stopped a car on Interstate 5 
in Mission Viejo and found a dead Marine in the seat next to the driver, Randy 
Kraft. That discovery ended a string of murders so long that prosecutors say 
they may never know the total. Six years after his arrest, Kraft was convicted 
of 16 murders, but prosecutors think that he may have committed 65 or more, the 
most in U.S. history. The trial was the county's longest (13 months, with five 
years of preparation) and most expensive (an estimated $10 million). 
DENTISTRY DEATHS: 
Dr. Tony Protopappas, who built a million-dollar practice based on painless 
dentistry, was arrested and later convicted of second-degree murder after three 
patients died from his anesthesia. Protopappas was an "unqualified, arrogant 
man" who used methods as reckless as "shooting a gun into a crowd," his 
prosecutor said. 
FIRST BILLIONAIRE: 
Donald L. Bren bought control of the Irvine Co., moved to Orange County and 
instantly became its biggest wheel. 
LAST (BUT LONG) HURRAH: 
Joan Irvine Smith, great-granddaughter of the Irvine, whose ranch once covered 
one-fifth of Orange County's territory, spent three decades fighting for what 
she considered her legacy -- the Irvine Co. stock she inherited. But she was so 
at odds with new owner Bren that she decided to sell him her stock rather than 
associate with him. Hers has been a lengthy exit, however. The lawsuit over the 
selling price persists into the '90s. 
PIER PRESSURE: 
Huge waves from offshore winter storms ripped away a section of the Seal Beach 
Pier. The waves returned three months later to finish the job, this time 
tearing away the end of the Huntington Beach Pier, including the End Cafe. (See 
"Goodby Again.") 
LABOR OF LOVE: 
Dennis Holland, working virtually single-handed for 13 1/2 years in his front 
yard in Costa Mesa, hand-wrought a 100-foot wooden brigantine according to 
19th-Century plans and christened it Pilgrim. As it slid into Newport Harbor, 
2,500 people cheered and scores of boats tooted -- probably the biggest and 
most festive launching crowd in the harbor's history. 
The Rest of the Decade. . . 
CAUGHT AT LAST II: 
The Night Stalker, who sneaked into homes to rape and murder, struck in Mission 
Viejo and sent Orange County residents scurrying to buy guard dogs and guns 
(1985). Both Mission Viejo victims survived, and the attack provided the clue 
that broke the case. A 13-year-old boy's description of a suspicious vehicle 
led police to a Texas drifter, Richard Ramirez. Convicted of 13 murders but 
defiant to the end, Ramirez was sentenced to death four years later in Los 
Angeles. 
INFERNO: 
A tree swaying in a severe Santa Ana wind brushed a power line. The resulting 
fire gutted an entire section of Anaheim. The epic blaze destroyed 50 buildings 
containing 525 apartments and turned 1,200 people into instant homeless. The 
damage was estimated at $50 million. Miraculously, no one was seriously injured 
(1982). 
INFERNO II: 
Six months after the Anaheim conflagration, a brush fire erupted in Gypsum 
Canyon behind Orange and spread to the nearby, very pricey Crest de Ville 
community. Twelve homes were leveled there and three others nearby (1982). 
TERRORISM AT HOME: 
Alex M. Odeh, 41, regional director of the American-Arab Anti-Defamation 
Committee, opened his office door in Santa Ana and was fatally injured by a 
bomb. The FBI's suspicions fell on members of the Jewish Defense League, but no 
arrests have been made (1985). 
FERTILITY RECORD: 
Patricia Frustaci checked into St. Joseph Hospital in Orange and delivered the 
first septuplets in U.S. history. Although just three survived, the Frustacis 
said they were blessed and returned to Riverside. After the worldwide hoopla 
subsided, they sued the doctor who had administered fertility drugs (1984). 
CHILDREN AS PREY: 
It's called Caspers Wilderness Park, but no one took that literally until a 
young mountain lion sprang from the brush and carried away 5-year-old Laura 
Small. Laura, rescued almost immediately, was left partially paralyzed and 
blind in one eye. Seven months later, Justin Mellon, 6, was similarly attacked. 
The park was closed and a hunt begun. When the park reopened three months 
later, visitors were warned to stay with their children (1986). 
SURF RIOT: 
There were 100,000 people on the beach the final day of the Ocean Pacific Pro 
Surfing Championships in Huntington Beach when a group of beach-goers behind 
the grandstand became rowdy, then violent. Soon a full-scale riot was under 
way. By darkness, riot police had cleared the beach, but not before several 
police and lifeguard vehicles had been burned, more than 40 people injured and 
13 people arrested (1986). 
OLYMPIC FEVER: 
Lots of the excitement and some of the pageantry of the Los Angeles Olympics 
spilled over into Orange County. The biggest happening: bicycle races through 
Mission Viejo (1984). 
MISSING CHILD: 
Three-year-old Laura Bradbury of Huntington Beach disappeared from the family 
campsite at Joshua Tree National Monument, apparently a kidnap victim, touching 
off what grew into a nationwide search captained by her father (1984). Five 
years later, her family continued to deny the possibility of her death despite 
DNA tests showing bone fragments found near the campsite "were consistent with 
Laura Bradbury". 
MURDER MYSTERY: 
Edward Lee Cooperman, a Cal State Fullerton physicist, was found shot to death 
in his office. But why? A student, Vietnamese immigrant Minh Van Lam, said it 
had been an accident. Cooperman's friends said it had been an assassination 
prompted by Cooperman's humanitarian and scientific aid to Communist Vietnam. 
The judge scoffed at the assassination theory and convicted Lam of involuntary 
manslaughter (1984). 
MONEYGATE: 
Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan, based in Irvine, spent five years on the financial 
fast track of junk bonds and high-risk real estate before federal regulators 
took it over (1989) and calculated that it could cost taxpayers $2 billion to 
bail it out. After Lincoln's collapse, Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of 
Lincoln's parent company, found himself the subject of congressional, civil and 
criminal investigations. Joining him on the hot seat were politicians whose 
favor he had cultivated -- including U.S. Sen. Alan Cranston of California. 
MUNIGATE: 
One of the biggest judicial investigations in California focused on Harbor 
Municipal Court in Newport Beach, where six judges came under scrutiny (1989). 
In the end, Judge Brian R. Carter, suspected of exchanging courtroom favors for 
sex, retired rather than undergo a formal disciplinary hearing. Evidence 
included a taped conversation between Carter and a prostitute in which he 
stated, "This is the one you owe me." And Judge Calvin P. Schmidt was publicly 
rebuked for giving preferential treatment to a friend's daughter and making 
improper campaign contributions. 
GATESGATE: 
A jury heard weeks of allegations that Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates had 
used his investigators to harass political opponents by tape-recording their 
conversations and trumping up charges against them. Their verdict: Gates must 
pay $189,894 to the private investigator who filed the suit. 
SECOND THOUGHTS: 
Cinnamon Brown, 14, confessed to murdering her stepmother and was sentenced to 
prison (1985). Case closed? Not quite. After three years in stir, she conceded 
to investigators that she had taken the rap for her father out of "love and 
loyalty." Officers arrested David Arnold Brown, an Anaheim Hills businessman, 
who they said took out $835,000 in life insurance on his wife, persuaded his 
daughter to confess to the murder, then married his dead wife's sister. Later, 
more charges were filed against Brown: trying, while in jail, to hire the 
murders of key prosecution figures. David Brown's trial is pending. 
TRAGIC MISTAKE II: 
Beverly Jean Ernst, 27, said she wanted only to lie down and asked her 
boyfriend to watch her 3-month-old twins napping outside in a car in Garden 
Grove. But by the time she checked on them five hours later, they were dead 
from the summer heat, estimated to have reached 120 degrees inside the car. 
Tried for involuntary manslaughter, she was convicted of child endangerment and 
sentenced to four years in prison. "It's not fair," she said to her attorney 
(1986). 
TRAGIC MISTAKE III: 
A Costa Mesa police helicopter, helping to pursue a suspect, passed the chase 
to a Newport Beach police helicopter as the suspect's car crossed over the city 
limit. But within seconds, the two helicopters collided and crashed. All three 
people aboard the Costa Mesa craft were killed. Miraculously, the two Newport 
officers survived (1987). 
DEADLY CLOUD: 
About 7,500 people fled their homes and jobs when an arsonist touched off a 
fire in an Anaheim pesticides and fertilizer warehouse (1985). More than 80 
chemicals, some of them lethal, were released over sections of Anaheim, 
Fullerton and Placentia. Only emergency workers were allowed in the area for 
four days. The owner of the warehouse, the Larry Fricker Co., later agreed to 
pay $200,000 for the cleanup. More than 300 claims were filed, alleging lost 
work time, respiratory infections and burdensome hotel, food and medical bills. 
HOME, v.EET HOME: 
The cost of houses, which began to spiral up in the '70s, went through the roof 
in the '80s. The average price of a house was about $150,000 at the start of 
the decade and was flirting with $400,000 at the end. 
NEAREST MISS: 
At John Wayne Airport, Air California Flight 336 tried to land on the runway 
where Air California Flight 931 was taking off, forcing 336's pilot to belly-in 
his Boeing 737 at the last second. The plane was mangled, but of the 104 
aboard, just 33 were injured, and no one was killed (1981). 
CHANGING FACE: 
The 1980 census put the county's minority population at about 22%, but a 
decade-long migration of Mexicans, Vietnamese and El Salvadorans raised the 
figure to an estimated 27%, and still climbing. 
TRAFFIC: 
It was a problem in 1980. It was a bigger problem in 1989. With two 
transportation taxes defeated, population still growing and cars still 
everyone's favorite wheels, there was no solution in sight. 
Newsmakers 
John Paul Bostrom, 13 months, and Eugenie Wilhelmina Bostrom, 2 weeks, went in 
for a medical checkup, the first step in events that eventually blew their 
secret: They were the out-of-wedlock children of family man and right-wing 
moralist John G. Schmitz, 51, once a congressman but then state senator from 
Corona del Mar. Their mother, Swedish-born Carla Stuckle, 43, had been one of 
Schmitz's students at Santa Ana College and a Republican volunteer. Stuckle 
said that Schmitz, married 28 years with seven children, eventually offered to 
pay $200 a month in child support but told her he couldn't pay more and still 
maintain his wife's life style (1981). 
Andrija Artukovic, frail from 85 years of living, was seized at his home in 
Surfside and ordered sent to Yugoslavia, becoming the highest-ranking Nazi war 
criminal ever extradited from the United States (1985). The Yugoslavs said that 
while Nazi interior minister of Croatia, Artukovic ordered entire town and 
village populations executed. Before a firing squad could carry out his 
sentence, Artukovic died of old age in a prison in Yugoslavia (1988). 
Mel C. Yorba, 17, of Riverside, became Disneyland's first murder victim (1981). 
W. Patrick Moriarty, an Anaheim fireworks manufacturer determined to prevent 
anti-fireworks laws, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to influence 
legislation. He wound up indicted and pleading guilty to bribing government 
officials and giving kickbacks to bankers (1985). Called one of the most 
significant political corruption cases in recent California history, the 
Moriarty affair led to indictment of city council members, bankers and one 
state legislator. 
David P. Jacobsen of Huntington Beach, a hospital administrator held hostage in 
Lebanon for 17 months, returned home to an outpouring of welcomes and 
patriotism. Released after U.S. arms shipments to Iran, Jacobsen praised Lt. 
Col. Oliver L. North as a hero, criticized news media probing of the 
transaction and at the White House tried to protect President Reagan from 
hostile questions by ordering reporters to "back off" (1986). 
Father Lawrence Jenco was also released by Lebanese terrorists after 19 months 
in captivity and was assigned by the Catholic Church to temporary duty in 
Orange County (1986). Asked what he thought of the arms shipment that freed 
him, the priest said: "I can't comprehend why we have to ship arms and kill 
innocent men, women and children. It doesn't make sense to me. . . . I would 
have said, 'No, I will stay.' " 
Sheryl Lynn Massip repeatedly tried to kill her 6-week-old son and finally 
succeeded by running over him with the family Volvo. Her attorneys said she 
suffered from postpartum psychosis, a rare maternal disorder that causes severe 
anxiety, delusions and sometimes violence. A jury convicted her of 
second-degree murder (1988), but the trial judge overturned the verdict. "I 
didn't have any choice but to find her insane," Superior Court Judge Robert R. 
Fitzgerald said. "She was bonkers." 
Wally, the 5 1/2-foot alligator who had lived in Upper Newport Bay for at least 
three years, was finally caught on a street in Irvine, much to the relief of 
local water birds. Too small for a zoo, Wally was sent to live in a 
herpetologist's private pond (1985). 
Roger R. Stanton, a Fountain Valley city councilman, launched an impossibly 
low-budget campaign against incumbent county supervisor Philip L. Anthony 
(1980) -- and won, apparently buoyed by Anthony's indictment for laundering 
campaign money. By decade's end, Stanton still firmly held the seat. 
Jose Luis Razo Jr., 21 -- pride of the La Habra barrio, fund-raiser for cancer 
victims, Boys Club leader, youth award winner, star high school scholar and 
athlete, scholarship winner, above-average student and linebacker at Harvard -- 
was also La Habra's Ski Mask Bandit. Razo confessed (1987) to a string of armed 
robberies during vacation breaks from Harvard, saying "I'm a home boy now. At 
Harvard, I didn't fit in." He later recanted his confession but was convicted 
and sentenced to 10 years in prison. 
Timothy Waisanen, former aide to TV evangelist Robert H. Schuller, blew the 
whistle on his old boss, revealing that fund-raising letters and photographs 
supposedly made during Schuller's trip to China had been faked months before 
Schuller departed. Schuller refused to comment, but his public relations 
spokesman, oblivious to the pun, called mailing the letters "a clerical error" 
(1987). 
The Irvine Northwood Little League All-Stars, winning 18 straight playoff games 
-- 12 of them by shutouts -- became the national champion and America's hope of 
dislodging powerhouse Taiwan at the 1987 Little League World Series. Final 
score: Taiwan, 21, Northwood 1 -- the worst shellacking in the series' history. 
On the other hand, the North Irvine Bobby Sox Minors won their second straight 
national softball championship (1987). 
Oddities 
HEY, YOU TWO: 
A gay couple were tossed out of Disneyland after caught dancing together on a 
dance floor (1980). The men filed suit, and five years later Disneyland quietly 
dropped its no-same-sex dancing rule. 
UP AGAINST THE WALL, BEAR: 
Disneyland's Winnie the Pooh was hauled into Superior Court by parents of a 
9-year-old girl who said Pooh had slugged their daughter at the park, causing 
$100,000 worth of bruises and headaches. In full costume, Winnie demonstrated 
that it had been an accident, nothing more than a smack from an ear when Pooh 
turned around. The jury deliberated 21 minutes and found the bear innocent 
(1980). 
UP AGAINST THE WALL, YOUR HONOR, WHENEVER IT'S CONVENIENT: 
Former Irvine Mayor Art Anthony beat his wife and nicked her with a bullet from 
a .45-caliber automatic pistol, sending her fleeing to the home of Police Chief 
Leo Peart. Peart, taking charge of the case, decided to let Anthony stay home 
that night, visited him twice the next day, allowed him to voluntarily check in 
to a psychiatric hospital and did not attempt an arrest for almost two days. 
Peart said later that moving too fast might have provoked a shoot-out (1981). 
THEY WHAT? 
The Angels won their division, then blew a two-game lead in the playoffs 
(1982). 
THEY W-H-A-T? 
The Angels won their division, then blew a two-game lead in the playoffs 
(1986). 
FOR ONE THING, THE RENT'S LOWER: 
Theodore Streleski, a Stanford mathematician who beat a professor to death with 
a hammer, chose to remain in prison rather than be paroled to Orange County. "I 
have nothing against Orange County," he said. "I understand it's got the best 
solid tax base in the state. But it's not my place." 
FREEWAY FEEDING FRENZY: 
Bank robbers fleeing police tossed cash onto the Costa Mesa Freeway, touching 
off a scramble among motorists. Police caught up to the pair but found $1,200 
of the loot missing (1985). 
GOOD CITIZEN AWARD: 
Deanna Young, 13, fresh from a lecture at church against drug abuse, turned in 
her parents to Tustin police for possessing about an ounce of cocaine and a 
small amount of marijuana (1986). Her parents, a bartender and a federal court 
clerk, later said they were proud of Deanna. Deanna said, "I'd do it again." 
KING OF THE JAILBIRDS: 
Willie Ray Wisely, convicted murderer and jailhouse lawyer supreme, set the 
record for longest stay in Orange County Jail -- more than seven years. Because 
he acted as his own attorney, he was provided with a private double cell, law 
books, a personal computer, a TV set, a telephone and a wife. (He secretly 
married his court-appointed law clerk during a jail visit.) Wisely was finally 
sent to Folsom Prison (1988) but continues to file motions occasionally. 
POLLGATE: 
Afraid that the Democrats would cheat, the Republicans got in the first punch. 
Blaming rumors that Democrats would truck illegal aliens to the polls, county 
Republican Chairman Thomas A. Fuentes approved stationing uniformed security 
guards at polls in 20 mostly Latino precincts of Santa Ana (1988). County 
officials ordered them away and local Latinos filed lawsuits, but the 
Republican candidate, Curt Pringle, narrowly won his seat in Congress, and no 
one was charged. Eventually a bill was passed in Sacramento making uniformed or 
armed guards at the polls a felony, and local Republicans paid $400,000 to 
settle the lawsuits. 
WAIT, LET ME EXPLAIN: 
Irvine applied for federal funds to convert an animal shelter into housing for 
the homeless (1987). (The feds later withdrew their grant because planes taking 
off from El Toro Marine Corps Air Station came too close to the site.) 
Hello... 
To car-pool lanes, appearing on the Costa Mesa Freeway (1985), spreading to the 
San Diego Freeway (1989) and prompting smiles or rage, depending on whether you 
were in one. 
To the Orange County Performing Arts Center, nurtured by land and money 
donations from C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons. Its opening (1986) ushered Orange 
County into the cultural big leagues, according to its promoters. 
To Rudy Castruita, who grew up in a Spanish-speaking home in El Monte, earned a 
doctorate at USC and became the first Latino superintendent of the Santa Ana 
Unified School District, the biggest in Orange County and eighth-largest in the 
state (1988). 
Goodby... 
To Edison Miller, Edmund G. Brown Jr., appointee to the Board of Supervisors, 
whose anti-war statements while a Vietnam POW made him anathema to 
conservatives. He was easily swept off the Board of Supervisors by Reagan 
Republican Bruce Nestande (1980). 
To the California Surf, who proved that Orange County wasn't ready for 
professional soccer (1981). 
To Richard Nixon, who moved out of San Clemente and became a New Yorker (1980). 
To John Briggs, Republican state senator from Fullerton for 15 years, who 
resigned with three years left in his term. He was bored, he said (1981). 
To Walter Knott, Orange County's most famous berry farmer, who died at age 91 
(1981). 
To James Myford Irvine, great-grandson of 19th-Century land baron James Irvine. 
He moved to Hawaii (1981). 
To Orange County International Raceway, the last drag strip in Southern 
California, lost to a business park development (1983). 
To affordable housing. Bowing to pressure from developers, the county 
supervisors scuttled its 5-year-old program that required builders to produce 
some lower-cost homes (1983). 
To C. David Baker's political career. So intent on bankrolling his campaign for 
a Republican congressional nomination, he forged the name of a Superior Court 
judge to a check and got caught (1988). 
To Ralph A. Diedrich, one-time baron of the Board of Supervisors. Imprisoned 
for bribery, defiant to the end, he died in San Diego (1988). 
To 44-year-old, barnstorming Meadowlark Airport in Huntington Beach, the last 
privately run airport in the Los Angeles and Orange County area (1989). Its 
successor: a shopping center and housing tract. 
Goodby Again (and Again and Again)... 
To the Huntington Beach Pier. A hurricane removed its end (1939), then winter 
storm waves did the same (1983 and 1988). As the '90s approached, Huntington 
Beach closed the remainder of the pier and announced plans to rebuild the whole 
thing. 
To the husbands of Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Rams. In the '80s, she 
married, then divorced musician/composer/convicted tax evader Dominic 
Frontiere, her seventh. 
Hello and Goodby... 
To drug guru Timothy Leary. Hired to be host for a talk show on KEZY radio in 
Anaheim, he was fired within a week (1980). 
To trauma centers. Five opened and were praised for saving the most critically 
injured patients (1980), but high costs began thinning their ranks. Two are 
gone, and the future of the remaining three could be tenuous. 
To Jewel Plummer Cobb, appointed president of Cal State Fullerton, the first 
black woman to head a major university in the West (1981). Eight years later, 
she announced that she would retire, effective in July. 
To the Orange County Centennial. After a year of celebration, the county turned 
100 on Aug. 1, 1989. 
Hello and Goodby (Maybe)... 
To the scourge of fruit growers, the Mediterranean fruit fly. The first one, a 
sterile male, appeared in Buena Park (1981), making local authorities jittery. 
But after a pregnant female was found in Brea (1989), the county's first aerial 
pesticide spraying began. 
Goodby and Hello... 
To Guy Snyder, 41, a Las Vegas hotel worker, who said he would sail round the 
world in 242 days and smash all sorts of records. He, his wife and his mother 
set out from Newport Harbor aboard We Made It, their 42-foot sailboat -- and 16 
days later made a U-turn for home, victims of seasickness (1980). 
To the Gay and Lesbian Student Education Union at Fullerton College. Rather 
than be forced by court order to recognize the group, the Board of Trustees 
withdrew recognition from all campus clubs (1980). The decision still stands, 
but G&amp;L eventually got onto campus by obtaining student government approval 
(1988). 
To Richard L. Fluharty, Eleazar Gonzales, Ly Hung, Michael D. Taylor and Steven 
Wilson, who checked out of Orange County Jail by rappelling four stories using 
a rope of knotted bedsheets (1988). One got no farther than a jail roof, one 
surrendered, two made it to Denver, and Taylor got as far as Chicago, where 
authorities believe he stuck up a jewelry store for $450,000 in loose gems. 
Within eight months, all were back in the slammer. 
Hello and Shut up... 
To the Pacific Amphitheatre, which opened to the cheers of audiences and the 
howls of neighbors (1983). The neighborhood took its complaint about concert 
noise to court, where it remained unresolved as the decade ended.
