Investors played it safe in 1988. But they would have been better off had they 
not. And being overly cautious this year also could be a mistake, many 
investment advisers say. 
Aided by takeovers, strong corporate earnings and other factors, stocks defied 
a mass exodus by individual investors to post double-digit gains last year. As 
the table accompanying this story shows, equities and equity mutual funds 
easily beat bonds, savings and most other conservative investments that small 
investors generally preferred amid lingering memories of the October, 1987, 
stock crash. 
But bonds -- led by the high-yield "junk" sector -- did well during the year, 
despite rising interest rates toward year-end that pushed prices down and 
partially offset gains in yields. 
Collectibles posted a mixed year, with art topping all major investments in 
1988 with a whopping 41.99% gain through November, and rare investment-grade 
coins finishing second. But stamp prices took a licking, rising just barely. 
The biggest losers: gold and silver, hit by abundant supplies and subdued fears 
of higher inflation. 
Will these trends continue in 1989? Not surprisingly, experts can't agree on 
the overall direction for stocks and bonds. But on some things there is general 
agreement: 
* Buyers of short-term bonds and money market funds will continue to enjoy 
among the best yields in years, at least into the early part of the year. 
* Although the Dow Jones industrial index closed 1988 near a post-crash high, 
plenty of individual stocks are depressed and have room to go much higher. 
* Some housing markets, such as those in California, will continue to be hot, 
while others, such as in oil-depressed areas and the Northeast, will remain in 
slumps. 
* Gold and silver are likely to remain dull, but platinum has a brighter 
outlook. 
* Blistering prices in the art market are due for a correction. 
Whether these predictions come true, of course, depends a lot on what happens 
to interest rates and the economy. Economists generally predict that interest 
rates will continue rising into the first part of the year, declining in the 
second half as economic growth slows. A recession may be a threat in late 1989 
and early 1990, economists say, but they have been crying wolf about a downturn 
for months now -- and the economy fortunately has not obliged. 
A recession "will happen eventually, but when is still too early too tell," 
says David A. Wyss, chief financial economist at Data Resources, reflecting the 
gun-shy attitude of many forecasters who have made it a habit of prematurely 
predicting recessions. 
Here is a review of opinions on some key segments for small investors: 
Bonds and savings 
Bonds had a good year generally, as "junk bonds," municipals and long-term 
investment-grade corporates posted double-digit total returns (including price 
appreciation and yield). 
Savers are enjoying among the highest yields in short-term investments in 
years, thanks to the Fed's tight-money policies. Yields on three-month Treasury 
bills, for example, recently hit 8.22%, the highest in 3 1/2 years. Recent 
9%-plus yields on two-year Treasuries have topped those on 30-year issues. 
Money market funds also look great, yielding an average of 8.52%, more than two 
percentage points better than the 6.20% average yields for bank money market 
deposit accounts. The spread normally is less than 1 point, but now is higher 
because money market funds generally move up faster in a rising interest rate 
environment, says Susan M. Cook, editor of Donoghue's Money Fund Report. 
Analysts generally expect short-term rates to continue rising well into the 
first half of this year. But toward mid-year, they say, interest rates should 
begin to decline, making money market funds and short-term Treasuries somewhat 
less attractive. 
Accordingly, some advisers say, investors should consider buying long-term 
Treasury issues. Even though they yield less than short-term issues now, they 
are a good way to lock in high yields, and they will gain in value once 
interest rates fall. 
For conservative investors who stick only to safe, federally insured bank 
certificates of deposit, the outlook is both good and bad. Banks will continue 
to be slow in boosting CD rates to keep up with rises in the prime rate and 
other market interest rates, says Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate 
Monitor. 
"There is no reason to believe that banks in '89 will suddenly get religion to 
help the consumer," Heady says. 
On the other hand, those who shop for the highest-yielding CDs nationwide are 
finding that troubled institutions no longer dominate the list of firms with 
highest savings rates. 
In the past year, the percentage of troubled Texas thrifts on the lists of 
institutions with top-yielding CDs has plummeted from 75% to 13%, Heady says. 
They have been replaced by much-stronger Northeastern institutions, who are 
boosting rates to attract deposit money that can then be loaned out to fuel 
that region's bustling economy. That trend should continue this year, Heady 
says. 
Stocks 
Surprising many experts, stocks had a good year last year, with Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500-stock index gaining 16.61% with dividends reinvested. The Dow Jones 
industrial index closed at 2,168.57, close to its post-crash high of 2183.50. 
But there is no consensus that the good times will continue rolling. 
Even normally bullish brokerage houses disagree. Dean Witter, for example, 
leads the bulls in suggesting that investors put 71% of their assets into 
stocks, versus 25% in bonds and only 4% in cash equivalents. But over at Paine 
Webber, bearish analysts advise only 14% in equities, versus 35% in bonds and a 
whopping 51% in cash equivalents. 
Clearly, experts are looking at much of the same data but are coming to 
different conclusions. The bulls see low price-earnings ratios (stock prices 
divided by earnings per share) on the S&amp;P 500 of about 12, down from above 
20 before the crash and more than 15 after the crash. They also cite strong 
gains in corporate profits and cash flow, and predictions that takeovers will 
continue at 1988's hot pace. 
The bulls also point to the high degree of pessimism among investment advisers. 
Such bearishness is actually bullish, they say, because it means that a lot of 
selling has already occurred. "A lot of people have a lot of cash, and that's a 
mistake," says John D. Connolly, chairman of the investment policy committee at 
Dean Witter. 
But the bears counter that there is still a lot more cash that could hit the 
sidelines before stocks are ready to take off again. High yields on Treasury 
securities and other fixed-income investments are siphoning off money that 
otherwise would go to stocks. Recent rallies have occured with low trading 
volume and relatively few stocks setting new 52-week highs, they say. And the 
threat of recession and slower economic growth bodes poorly for equities. 
Weighing all arguments, some experts are straddling the fence. The Dow, they 
say, will continue to trade in a narrow range between 1,900 and 2,200. 
"Until there is some direction from the new Bush Administration on fundamental 
economic issues, such as the budget deficit . . . the market is going to 
continue to trade in a narrow range," says Joseph Hardiman, president of the 
National Assn. of Securities Dealers. "Once we see how these issues are 
resolved, you'll see a (clearer) direction for the market, whether up or down." 
The key to investing, many experts say, will be in picking the right stocks 
that will perform well regardless of the overall market's direction. Shying 
away from the market completely -- as many investors have done -- could result 
in many missed opportunities, they say. 
Real Estate 
The outlook for home prices will continue to be mixed, with some markets 
remaining hot while others will stay behind, says John A. Tuccillo, chief 
economist for the National Assn. of Realtors. 
In California, home prices will continue to post strong gains, although slower 
economic growth will dampen price hikes somewhat, he says. 
Thanks to the influx of new residents, a strong economy and restrictions in new 
housing due to slow-growth measures, California boasted five of the 10 markets 
nationwide with the most price appreciation in 1988. Those five -- Orange 
County, San Diego, Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and San Fernando 
Valley -- each posted gains of more than 15%, Tuccillo says. 
The Midwest also will show strong increases, but the Northeast and Oil Patch 
states will remain sluggish, Tuccillo says. 
As for office buildings and other commercial real estate, many markets remain 
soft due to overbuilding, slow economies and loss of tax breaks under tax 
reform. Accordingly, yields on many limited partnerships and real estate 
investment trusts have been declining. Investors must be careful, because with 
fewer tax breaks, real estate investments will have to make it largely on their 
economics. 
"You don't have the tax factor working for you, so there is nothing to bail you 
out if you make a mistake," Tuccillo says. 
Precious Metals 
Gold and silver were among the top performers in 1987, but they flopped last 
year. And this year promises not to be much better, many experts say. 
Both gold and silver face plentiful supplies and only modest increases in 
demand. And inflation is expected to increase only modestly, dampening buying 
of metals for their traditional roles as inflation hedges. 
On the other hand, industrial demand for platinum is expected to rise, despite 
a recent announcement by Ford Motor that it had developed a platinum substitute 
in catalytic converters, which account for one third of worldwide demand. 
Collectibles 
In fine art, caution is the word for 1989. Prices continued to rise to dizzying 
heights last year, confounding many experts. Sotheby's, the big auction house, 
reported record or new record prices in Impressionist and Contemporary art, but 
strong rises even hit lower price categories. If history is any guide, this 
boom can't last forever, experts say. 
Stamps, however, posted a modest year, but observers are encouraged by recent 
pickups in prices at auctions, says Elaine R. Boughner, managing editor of 
Linn's Stamp News. 
Many types of collector coins also gained only modestly. But rare, top 
investment-grade coins posted double-digit gains, as investors were encouraged 
by improved grading standards, says Keith M. Zaner, editor of Coin World 
Trends. More investors are expected to enter the market this year through new 
mutual funds or limited partnerships, Zaner says. 
The hottest collector market? Consider baseball cards. Prices of rare, 
mint-condition cards of such former greats as Mickey Mantle have increased more 
than five-fold in recent years.
