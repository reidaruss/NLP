For two years, Delores Sanchez has been dishing up burritos, carnitas, tacos 
and hot coffee from a catering truck near the Figueroa Market in Cypress Park. 
"She has two babies," said Jose Luis Martinez, who was helping Sanchez chop 
meat one recent morning. "She has to work for them." 
But not everyone is pleased with Sanchez's choice of professions. Complaints 
about catering trucks from East Los Angeles to Brentwood have led to new calls 
at Los Angeles City Hall for stiff regulations on the rolling restaurants, 
which have become a roadside institution in many parts of the city. 
In East Los Angeles and elsewhere, some restaurant owners complain that the 
trucks compete unfairly with them, and merchants and residents say they 
monopolize parking spaces. Residents also complain about litter, crowded 
curbsides, and in some cases, late-night revelry. 
"The trucks are a real nuisance to neighborhoods," said Councilwoman Gloria 
Molina, who had bottles tossed at her recently when she asked a driver on 
Figueroa Street near Avenue 43 to move his truck. "In our neighborhood it 
creates public drinking. With the taco or whatever they are purchasing, they 
also have their beer they bought at the liquor store. We have to eliminate it." 
The Los Angeles City Council is expected to consider a proposed ordinance this 
month that would restrict catering truck stops to one half-hour. Other 
proposals being considered by the council would ban the trucks from residential 
streets and sharply increase fines for violations. 
"The thrust of this is to allow the industry to continue, but to regulate it in 
a meaningful way," said Councilman Marvin Braude, who proposed the half-hour 
limit. 
Councilman Nate Holden, who heads the council's transportation committee, said 
the trucks have assumed a role far larger than city officials envisioned when 
they last imposed regulations more than a decade ago. 
"They were intended to go visit construction sites," Holden said. 
But catering truck drivers say times have changed. Southern Californians value 
convenience, they say, and that extends beyond the construction and factory 
workers looking for a cold soda during a break. As a result, the area has grown 
into the catering truck capital of the country, with 5,000 trucks licensed in 
Los Angeles County alone. 
Some of the drivers say they would be forced out of business if the city 
imposed new restrictions on their hours because they depend on one stop for 
their livelihood. Sanchez, as an example, typically spends five to six hours a 
day on Huron Street. 
"We don't know what we would do," said Martinez. 
In Wilmington, Sabado Ramirez expressed similar gloom. "I would have to go to 
factories looking for people who want lunch," said Ramirez, who parks his truck 
near auto salvage yards on Blinn Avenue. "But that is real hard. There are a 
lot of catering trucks." 
On Wednesday, about 50 trucks circled Los Angeles City Hall and several dozen 
drivers and family members marched on the sidewalk outside the Spring Street 
entrance to protest the proposed restrictions. The picketers said they belong 
to the Independent Catering Truck Owners Assn., a month-old group of 300 
drivers who do not work for large catering companies. 
Tony Sosa, a driver from East Los Angeles and president of the group, said the 
large catering companies control most traditional routes at factories and 
office buildings, forcing independent drivers to look for business on the 
streets. 
"We need to stay five or six hours at one location to make a living," Sosa 
said. "Some of us park near hospitals where there are different break times. 
You can't just park there for a half hour and move on. You would miss most of 
your customers." 
Kelly Ramirez, executive director of Industrial Caterers Assn., said his 
organization is also concerned about the proposed restrictions and will attempt 
to work with the city over the next month to soften them. The group, which 
represents large catering companies, accounts for about half of the catering 
trucks licensed by the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services. 
"I think the Los Angeles Police Department has a lot better things to do than 
go around and bother caterers who are trying to feed people," said Ramirez. 
One driver in Wilmington said he feared the new regulations are racially 
motivated, a charge city officials deny. "A lot of people don't like Hispanic 
people," said Pablo Vargas, who has parked his truck for two years on Blinn. 
"They don't like us working here." 
The protesters outside City Hall on Wednesday -- almost all of whom were Latino 
-- also said the new restrictions would be discriminatory. Several carried 
placards proclaiming, "Do not violate our civil rights" and "discrimination 
against Hispanics." 
"We want to better ourselves," said Sosa. "But it seems they want to keep us 
down." About 90% of those in the catering truck industry in Los Angeles are 
Latino, according to the Industrial Caterers Assn. The group estimates that the 
industry employs about 8,000 Latinos, most of whom frequent construction sites 
and factories. 
Councilwoman Molina said at a recent council meeting that it is important the 
city craft a "balanced law" that does not hurt operators who are not causing 
problems. "Let's get those that have been abusing a privilege they've had for a 
long time," Molina said. 
Catering trucks in the city of Los Angeles already fall under a series of 
regulations, including requirements that they not park within 100 feet of 
intersections and restaurant entrances, or within 200 feet of schools and 
freeway ramps. Sales are also restricted to the vehicle's curb side, and each 
truck is required to provide a trash can. 
The city attempted to impose tougher requirements in the 1970s, at one point 
limiting curbside sales to 10 minutes. But catering truck drivers successfully 
challenged the restrictions in court, and later, Mayor Tom Bradley vetoed an 
ordinance that he said was too restrictive. Bradley has not taken a position on 
the current proposals. 
This time, however, Councilman Braude said his office has "carefully 
researched" the issue in hopes of avoiding the pitfalls of the past. The 
10-minute restriction was struck down in 1975 because it did not specify how 
far a truck must move after the period elapsed. In his current proposal, Braude 
has suggested that the truck be required to move at least one-half mile after a 
one-half hour stop. 
Deputy City Atty. Henry Morris said the state Motor Vehicle Code authorizes the 
city to impose restrictions on catering trucks so long as they are based on 
public safety concerns. It will not be difficult to meet such a test with the 
proposed new regulations, he said, because many trucks pose potential hazards 
for pedestrians and motorists. 
"This is particularly true around peak times, such as breaks or lunch," Morris 
said. "You have a lot of people for whatever reason are pressed for time, and 
they need to move. . . . An individual could be forced, perhaps due to the 
density of the crowd, to traverse the roadway. Any time you have that kind of 
situation, you have potential for hazard to people." 
Other Los Angeles area cities already impose tough restrictions on catering 
trucks, with Glendale's 4-year-old ordinance regarded as one of the most 
restrictive. Trucks there can park on public streets for just 10 minutes unless 
they receive a special permit from the city. City Clerk Aileen Boyle said only 
five of the 100 catering trucks there have been given extensions, ranging from 
one hour to four hours. 
The Glendale law, like the proposed Los Angeles restrictions, does not deal 
directly with trucks that park on private property. Glendale and Los Angeles 
officials said other city ordinances, such as building and zoning codes, 
already restrict food sales on private property. 
In the city of Los Angeles, problems with the trucks are as diverse as the 
communities they serve. On the Westside, the 22-foot-long modified Chevrolet 
Step Vans dish up breakfast and lunch to gardeners, swimming pool cleaners, 
painters and repairmen in affluent Brentwood neighborhoods. 
But some residents in those neighborhoods don't think much of the fast-food 
road shows. Along Kenter Avenue, where several caterers set up shop every day, 
homeowners want them out. 
"I can't even get out of my driveway," said Nancy Real, a resident of Kenter, 
which is often cluttered with pickup trucks and vans as workers pull over for a 
bite to eat. "I have a little boy I take to school, and twice we have almost 
been hit by cars." 
In Cypress Park and other parts of northeast Los Angeles, residents don't worry 
about gardeners blocking their driveways. They say they are concerned about 
crime. 
Some trucks have become hazards in those areas because of rowdy crowds they 
attract, city officials said. Shortly after 6 p.m., the trucks line up outside 
liquor stores and bars, often becoming a gathering place for "riffraff," as one 
city official described it. Many trucks remain in one place six to eight hours, 
officials said. 
Some catering truck operators, however, complain that the city is going after 
the wrong guy. "We don't sell the alcohol," one driver said. 
Problems with catering trucks on L Street near Avalon Boulevard in Wilmington 
led to a city experiment several months ago that harbor-area Councilwoman Joan 
Milke Flores said has flopped. City officials posted "No Parking" signs along a 
stretch of L Street, eliminating the catering trucks but also wiping out 
valuable curbside parking for visitors at a nearby senior citizens center. 
Flores has proposed an alternate pilot program for Wilmington, which would keep 
catering trucks off public streets by restricting them to construction and 
industrial sites. In addition, parking on streets where catering trucks have 
been a problem would be posted with one-hour limits. 
Merchants in downtown Wilmington had complained to Flores about a proliferation 
of catering trucks, including some that sell clothing, toys and other non-food 
items in addition to the routine tacos and soda. Laura Warren said the trucks 
are an eyesore and compete with local businesses. 
"They belong at the docks, or construction sites or at a warehouse, and then 
only for a limited time," said Warren, a real estate agent at All American 
Realty. 
Flores said she favors larger fines for violators -- currently, fines range 
from $25 to $100 -- and limits on how long trucks can stay in one location. But 
she said the city will have to find some way to make the proposed half-hour 
restriction stick. 
"It will be difficult to enforce this without having a police officer standing 
there full time," she said. "You may just have a turnover of trucks one after 
another." 
Ramirez of the caterers association said the council must be careful not to 
penalize an entire industry because of what he described as a few bad caterers. 
"Our people are not going out there to break the law," he said. "They are 
providing a service to their clientele."
