Who is Celia Brady and why is she saying all those terrible things about 
Hollywood? 
Brady is the pseudonymous show business columnist for Spy magazine, the 
2-year-old New York-based satirical monthly that startled the journalism world 
with its cutting-down-to-size exposes about the Rich and Famous. And some of 
Brady's recent jabs at moviedom's high and mighty published under the heading 
"The Industry" include claims that: 
 -- "Die Hard" movie producer Joel Silver is a "taste-free bullyboy" whose 
"involvement in the movies is justified on the dubious grounds that one needs a 
larger-than-life producer (read: manipulative despot) to deal with the 
industry's larger-than-life talents (read: manipulative despots)." 
 -- Creative Artists Agency chief Michael Ovitz is a "personality-free" power 
monger, who rarely deserves mention without his stock epithet: "The 
Manipulator." 
 -- NBC executive Brandon Tartikoff was plotting with "short-fingered vulgarian 
Donald Trump" about taking over a studio. 
 -- And Columbia Pictures Entertainment CEO Victor (The Briefcase) Kaufman "has 
apparently begun to weary" of Columbia President Dawn Steel's "tirades. Next 
stop for Steel: an independent production deal within 12 to 15 months." 
The question of Brady's identity isn't just a matter of bemused speculation. So 
caustic has been Brady's pen and so high-placed her victims that one powerful 
agent is widely rumored to have put a private detective on her trail. (After 
all, Brady frequently ends her columns with the teasing line "See you Monday 
night at Morton's.") 
E. Graydon Carter, editor of Spy along with Kurt Andersen, claims Ovitz offered 
Rupert Murdoch's publication about the movie industry, Premiere magazine, "an 
interesting internal document" in exchange for Brady's identity, apparently 
thinking that journalists could ferret out the information. But a Premiere 
editor believed the offer was actually made by only a "CAA underling," who was 
apparently bucking for a promotion. A Creative Artists Agency spokesman denied 
that the document incident took place. 
Still others, in particular Hollywood producers, screenwriters and even some 
journalists, worry that they are unjustly under suspicion of complicity with 
the column and their projects will suffer as a result. 
But Andersen and Carter, both former staffers at Time Inc., boast that the real 
reason for the furor is that "The Industry" column is finally providing the 
hard-ball reporting that Hollywood's megalomania deserves. And they can get 
away with it, Carter says, "because Spy was designed as a magazine that could 
exist without the access that most celebrity-driven magazines must have. We 
don't need Morgan Fairchild's publicist to be friends with us to put out this 
magazine each month." 
Although the magazine has only 130,000 subscribers, its articles make the 
rounds by word of mouth among the trendier folks in New York and Los Angeles. 
And what gets their attention is Brady's irreverence toward the sacred cows of 
Hollywood -- studio executives and producers. 
But much as the magazine editors claim to loathe Hollywood, they also seem to 
be embracing it. Since its inception, Spy has retained the International 
Creative Management talent agency for its book tie-ins. But only within the 
past year and a half has the magazine used that firm's L.A. office to pursue 
production deals. 
Already, Spy is planning an HBO television special to spotlight the magazine's 
caustic/comic subject matter, according to Esther Newberg, an ICM agent in New 
York. 
"They're a very strong client. We consider them one of the hottest items in 
town," says Newberg. 
And it remains to be seen whether producers will try to dangle fat deals before 
the magazine in hopes of avoiding Brady's lash. For instance, editor Andersen 
says it was "purely coincidental" that Brady's May, 1988, column actually said 
something nice about producers Jon Peters and Peter Guber after their 
representatives had met with Carter and Andersen last spring about, in 
Andersen's words, "possibly doing a TV show together." 
"Before, during and since then, we've had unkind things to say about them," 
Andersen says. 
But the editor does acknowledge that the possibility of conflict of interest is 
a real issue. Making Hollywood deals, he says, also "makes it more difficult to 
be utterly impartial if we do indeed have any kind of ongoing involvement with 
TV. It would be disingenuous to say there would be no applied pressure. It gets 
dicier, certainly, when you're not entirely an outsider. And it's something 
we're concerned about and will endeavor to not have cloud our judgments." 
What makes it easier, he notes, is that the Brady column "is not written by us 
or generated in-house, which keeps it at arm's length from our discussions." 
Carter and Andersen swear up and down that Brady, whose name is taken from the 
narrator in F. Scott Fitzgerald's "The Last Tycoon," is "one person" and not a 
composite. 
They also say the columnist is not a Hollywood agent, despite widespread 
speculation to the contrary, and even claim the individual is writing a 
screenplay under the Celia Brady name. 
Associates of the editors say the pair closely guard the identity of the 
columnist even from magazine insiders. 
"I've asked (Gray and Andersen) many, many times, and they won't tell me," says 
contributing editor Paul Rudnick, who has occasionally been fingered himself as 
a possible Brady contributor -- which he says he isn't. 
Even so, several other Spy insiders say they are virtually certain that Brady 
is a composite -- essentially, a voice invented by the editors, who do most of 
the writing, based on reports drawn from a number of sources, including at 
least a couple of "Deep Throats" from Hollywood's agency and executive ranks. 
"The fact is that this column seems to me like a composite," says Lynn 
Hirschberg, a Spy contributor who edited the magazine's Los Angeles "Life-Style 
Hell" September issue. Hirschberg denies being Brady, but will neither confirm 
nor deny whether she contributes to the column. 
Susan Lyne, editor of Premiere magazine, says it is her understanding that Spy 
is using a "Harvard Mafia" (Andersen went to Harvard) and also some prep school 
connections on the West Coast to "deliver lots and lots of choice morsels to 
them. There are, in fact, 15 or 20 people feeding into it every month." 
Carter acknowledges that he does "weave" stories from people other than the 
alleged Brady into the column. Entertainment executives and journalists say 
they've received calls from males and females identifying themselves as "Spy's 
Celia Brady." Andersen says the calls were probably from members of the 
magazine's fact-checking staff. 
Claiming the column, as the rest of the magazine, is carefully edited, Spy's 
editors like to boast that "The Industry's" mix of unattributed reporting and 
vituperative comment has yet to be hit with a libel suit. 
But it certainly isn't perfect. To begin with, Fitzgerald's mythical narrator 
was actually named Cecilia Brady. And, on close examination, other factual 
misfires do occur. 
For instance, a potshot at New York Times entertainment writer Aljean Harmetz 
in the December column appears to miss the mark. Brady accuses Harmetz of 
foolishly quoting Variety's Art Murphy to the effect that any picture grossing 
$30 million or more at the box office at the time of its video release would be 
a financial success. 
"I guess it would have been too taxing for Harmetz to think through this 
assertion and consider, say, pictures that cost more than $30 million to make," 
sniped Brady. 
Guess again, Celia. 
What Harmetz actually wrote was: "Mr. Murphy considers $30 million to be the 
threshold for success when a movie is released on videocassette." In other 
words, $30 million in ticket sales usually means a successful run at the video 
store, which is a pretty innocuous and seemingly correct assertion. 
And, in the latest issue, Brady's column contains a glaring oversight when it 
claims Lorimar film chief Bernie Brillstein and "his arch-nemesis" Michael 
Ovitz at Creative Artists Agency are still feuding. Actually, if Brady were as 
hooked into Hollywood as she would have people believe, she would know that the 
two men smoothed over their feud last fall. 
Still, those Hollywood types who are reading Brady -- or the multiple Bradys -- 
are doing so avidly and/or angrily. "I laugh along with everybody else. It's 
fun to make fun of powerful people," says the president of one talent agency. 
Just as clearly, Hollywood is churning with a certain amount of fear of being 
ridiculed by Brady and Spy. "Please don't mention my name," says the same 
agent. "I have this nightmare that I'll be the only agent quoted in your story, 
and they'll come after me." 
(Some of the journalistic set seem to share the apprehension. "If you write 
about (Celia Brady), they'll come after you next. . . . And forget my name," 
warns one Vanity Fair staffer, who claims to know "exactly" who the columnist 
is.) 
Ironically, the column may be giving less grief to its subjects than to those 
people suspected, rightly or wrongly, of contributing to it. Among those who 
complain they are being hurt by false suspicion of involvement with Brady are: 
 -- Producer-journalist Lynda Obst. "I have not been and never will be a gossip 
columnist," Obst ("Adventures in Babysitting") says angrily of the persistent 
rumor that she is Celia Brady. A former New York Times editor who still writes 
occasionally for Premiere and other magazines, Obst says she doesn't believe in 
"unattributed gossip" and finds it "upsetting" that Hollywood peers have 
questioned her about writing for Spy. "I pray you get (Brady's identity)," she 
adds. 
 -- Journalist-screenwriter Bruce Feirstein. "This is a terrifying thought. . . 
. I earn my living in Hollywood. . . . How do I clear my name of this?" 
Feirstein ("Real Men Don't Eat Quiche") said when informed that four movie 
producers had privately expressed suspicion that he was contributing and had 
been a major source for Brady's Joel Silver column. The suspicion seems 
natural: Feirstein is listed on Spy's masthead as a contributing editor, and he 
has stayed in touch with Silver since the two went to high school in Maplewood, 
N.J. 
But Feirstein, who also writes for movies and TV, said he doesn't contribute to 
the column, doesn't know who does and doesn't really like Spy's uglier side, 
despite his friendship with Spy editor Carter. 
 -- Warner Bros. executive Lisa Henson. The rumor mill has similarly tried to 
tag Henson apparently because she went to Harvard with Spy executive editor 
Susan Morrison. Henson, the daughter of muppeteer Jim Henson, didn't return 
calls. But one friend explained that she doesn't contribute, because she 
doesn't want to compromise her position at Warner Bros. or in the industry in 
such an obvious way, and that she is "deeply distressed" by the talk. 
 -- Journalist-screenwriter Jean Vallely. "Everybody thinks it's me. I swear 
it's not!" says Vallely. A contributing editor to the Los Angeles Times 
Magazine and former columnist for GQ magazine, Vallely is working on a TV movie 
for CBS and a fiction book about Hollywood. She attributes the suspicion to her 
once having "sat next to Graydon (Carter) at dinner." 
Meanwhile, some are eager to meet Brady for other reasons. 
Paul Corkery, another journalist-screenwriter and a sometime Spy contributor 
who makes a few of the suspect lists says, "I hope she's real. . . . I'd like 
to date her." 
And Premiere's Lyne says: "If you find out who it is, tell me. I'll hire her." 
Got that, Celia? 
See you Tuesday night at Trumps.
