In this elegant old city of graceful mansions in muted tones, Bud Hall's House 
of Many Colors stands out like rap music at a Debussy concert. 
You can almost hear the hot pink, lavender and blue paint that covers Hall's 
nine-room Victorian home on Whitefield Square in the city's historic district. 
And his 9-foot tall windows look even louder, 10 of them covered with paintings 
of women dressed in colors of the rainbow. 
As expected in a city that prides itself on antebellum charm and architecture, 
a city that William Tecumseh Sherman spared after his March to the Sea because 
it was "too beautiful" to destroy, many Savannah preservationists look at 
Hall's home and see red. City officials took him to court, arguing that his 
home is not in character with the rest of the historic neighborhood. But Hall 
argues that preservation laws clash with his rights. 
Sitting in a room that he uses for his hair styling businesses, Hall said 
indignantly: "If I want to hang pictures of Zsa Zsa Gabor and Martin Luther 
King in my window, that's my right. Our country was founded on property 
rights." 
In many ways, Hall's house has come to symbolize increasingly worrisome issues 
surrounding the historic preservation movement. In Savannah, as in cities 
across the country, questions are being raised about whether the movement has 
become too powerful, too intrusive and whether preservation and progress are 
compatible -- and affordable. The questions take on added weight as aging 
cities increasingly rely on historic districts to attract visitors and help 
fuel their service economies. 
Across the nation, preservationists are battling to hold onto power they gained 
during the last several decades of heightened awareness of architectural 
treasures. 
In Charleston, S.C., and San Francisco, preservationists have taken a beating 
as they tried to convince some victims of the recent hurricane and earthquake 
that, in repairing their damaged property, they should spend the extra money it 
takes to buy materials like those destroyed rather than purchasing newer, 
cheaper ones. 
Pat Mellen of the Preservation Society of Charleston, said to be the nation's 
oldest such organization (70 years old), said, "You have to explain to them 
that you can put an asphalt roof on," instead of the more expensive metal, "but 
you're going to lose it in 10 years. You're also going to lose tourism" because 
the houses would not be attractive. 
In South Pasadena, Calif., homeowners -- backed by the National Trust for 
Historic Preservation -- struggle against a freeway that would destroy dozens 
of historic houses. One angry homeowner called that prospect "cultural 
suicide." The preservationists can lay claim to holding off the freeway for 20 
years, but they have not been able to kill it. The state continues to press 
forward with new plans. 
In Madison, Ga., preservationists sought to block the opening of a Hardee's 
hamburger shop which would result in the razing of two historic homes in the 
quaint old east Georgia town. But they lost. The restaurant now sits just off 
the town's main square, painted white, like many of the historic homes around 
it. 
"It's the only antebellum Hardee's in the world," said Don Stacy of the local 
chamber of commerce, adding that a Piggly Wiggly grocery store is located just 
across the street from Hardee's. "I wouldn't call it an antebellum Piggly 
Wiggly," he said, "but it is a quality construction with a quality appearance." 
Influence Considerable 
For many years, the preservation movement made great political headway. And its 
influence is still considerable, even dominating, in many communities. 
The national trust has identified 11 areas nationwide that it calls 
"endangered," including South Pasadena, St. Simons, Ga., and the historic 
district in Deadwood, S. D. "These places tell us who we were and who we are," 
said National Trust President J. Jackson Walter. "They deserve our protection." 
But a backlash of sorts has been building, and nowhere is it more apparent than 
in Savannah, where a 2.2-square-mile historic district graced by live oak trees 
dripping Spanish moss boasts of some 1,100 historic buildings and 22 landscaped 
squares. 
Savannah is among the nation's oldest planned cities -- James Oglethorpe laid 
it out in 1733 -- and possesses one of America's largest urban historic areas 
designated as a landmark district by the U.S. Interior Department. Thus, the 
plight of its preservation Establishment could set a pattern for others 
nationwide. 
"Savannah, along with other cities like Charleston, San Antonio and Annapolis 
that have been working to preserve their history, are the recognized and 
acknowledged exemplaries of historic preservation," Walter said. "Were it ever 
to be the case when one of those cities changed direction sharply, we would, I 
am certain, be alarmed" that other preservation efforts might be thwarted. 
"When the leaders fall, everybody else gets nervous." 
Sweeping Control 
Preservation officials exercise broad control over how a building is modified 
and over whether one is built at all in this city of 150,000. An 11-member 
Historic Board of Review that includes architects, builders and historians must 
approve "any type of alteration that is visible from the public right of way," 
said Beth Reiter, Savannah's preservation officer. 
The board is appointed by Mayor John Rousakis and the board of aldermen, 
serving three-year terms. 
The following changes are among those requiring a "certificate of 
appropriateness" approved by the board and issued by the zoning commissioner: 
 -- Demolition of a historic structure in the historic district. 
 -- "Material change in the exterior appearance of" structures in the district. 
 -- Moving a structure into, within or out of the district. 
 -- Adding or altering awnings. 
 -- "Material change" of existing walls, fences or sidewalks that are "subject 
to view from a public street or lane." 
Under a section of the ordinance called "visual compatibility factors," there 
are 11 categories for judging new construction and proposed changes. They range 
from height to roof shape to the "rhythm" (relationship) of the buildings with 
other structures. 
Preservationists argue that such considerations are not trivial, as they make a 
city palatable to visitors, thereby making money. "If we do not safeguard the 
character of our community, if we allow it to fray around the edges, people are 
not going to be interested in coming to see it," said Stephanie Churchill, 
executive director of the Historic Savannah Foundation. 
'Behaving Like Nazis' 
However, many here argue that focusing on the past is preventing progress for 
the future. The board is "behaving like Nazis or like czars," Hall said. 
"That's not what I want in my government." 
Many people here disparage preservation officials, and some have become local 
celebrities by defying city orders based on preservation officials' judgments. 
Michael Faber, a Savannah delicatessen owner ran up against the wrath of 
preservationists when he put up a red awning at his restaurant, located in the 
historic district -- despite the fact that his sandwiches passed strenuous 
taste tests. 
He won his fight, but his bitterness, tinged with humor, lingers. "Preserve the 
cemetery," Faber exhorts, "but don't put the businessman in it." 
One after another, he zings one-liners at preservationists: Having them sit 
around a table demanding to see paint samples is like "rearranging the deck 
chairs on the Titanic," and, "If the world stopped, it would take Savannah 25 
years to catch up." 
And just to rub in his indignation on city officials, Faber makes sure his 
bright red awning is well lighted at night, "so they don't miss it." His 
matching red window sign trumpets, in white letters, "Faber's. A Savannah 
Tradition since 1989." 
Walter of the national trust is unamused. Citing "the extraordinarily beautiful 
color of Old Savannah brick and the wonderful filigree of the wrought iron," he 
is against "turning your back on what makes the place special." 
Calling the current activist preservationist movement a "reaction against urban 
renewal," Walter said: "If there is anything we have learned over the last 20 
years, it is that the way you build a successful community is to make historic 
preservation part of the plan." 
Sign of Trouble 
A sign of the diminished clout of the preservationists was the construction of 
the Hyatt Regency Hotel along the Savannah River earlier in the decade. It is 
modest by many cities' standards, but here its peach-colored, boxy architecture 
looms among the historic buildings. Built by local developer Merritt W. Dixon 
III, it stands 7 stories high and has 346 rooms. The promise of its substantial 
tax revenue as the city's largest hotel overcame bitter opposition from the 
entrenched preservationist Establishment. 
But no clash over preservation values here has been more remarkable than Bud 
Hall's. 
It began in October, 1987, when Hall tried out several colors on the Queen 
Anne-style Victorian home, which was built in 1896. All the colors were 
authentic from the Victorian period, Hall said the other day, showing a visitor 
a chart called "Victorian Hues." He originally selected five colors, including 
Public House, a robin's-egg blue, and Andover, a pink. At one point he even 
painted his tin roof in pink stripes. 
The Savannah Historic Review Board pounced on Hall, slapping him with a 
stop-work order, arguing that his paint job was out of character with the rest 
of the neighborhood. "Sof-f-f-t," said Hall, derisively. "They wanted colors 
that were sof-f-f-t. Well, the Victorians were not soft. They were extremely 
eclectic. They were whimsical." 
The dispute escalated, with Hall getting hauled into court and fined $100. Last 
year, he had an artist paint women on plywood panels, asserting that the panels 
were an energy-saving measure for his windows. Preservationists and some of 
Hall's neighbors hate the panels, but they remain on the windows. 
"The windows are not a typical treatment for that style house," said Reiter in 
unaffected understatement. "It looks like stained glass." 
The house's notoriety has earned it a stop on the tour-bus route, and sometimes 
the guide toots her horn at Hall, whose home is known as "House of Many 
Colors." 
Hall now talks of bigger battles with City Hall. "I want economic change in 
this community," he said, asserting that the preservation Establishment should 
be joining him and others in that struggle instead of mounting a paint patrol. 
"We realize we need to attract business," said Reiter, but she argued that, in 
trying to curb Hall's eclecticism, she was trying to prevent "bit by bit, piece 
by piece, the unraveling of the historic district." Preservation and economic 
progress "are not mutually exclusive," Reiter said. 
But despite three decades of effort, preservationists have been unable to 
energize much of this city's commercial district, most notably Broughton Street 
and an ailing City Market, in the middle of the historic area. 
In one recent study, titled "Is Savannah Growing Senile?," a group of business 
and civic leaders calling itself Renaissance Savannah spared almost none of 
Establishment Savannah, criticizing business, political and media leaders. The 
report places the city ninth on a list of 14 Southeastern cities in population 
growth -- behind Orlando, Fla., Montgomery, Ala., and Augusta, Ga. The report 
likens Savannah to an "underdeveloped country." 
Said Julie Smith, a member of the group and a Chatham County commissioner: "The 
only industry that is growing is tourism. We need to get the city moving 
again." 
"We've had a lot of surveys, a lot of talking, a lot of writing and not a 
damned bit of action," said one longtime business owner here. 
It is debatable how much of this restiveness can be blamed on preservationists 
blocking progress and discouraging people from coming here, but Reiter 
acknowledges that "we're the target right now. Preservation is a wonderful 
focal point." 
Bud Hall is doing all he can to keep it that way, although, he says, he has 
gone broke fighting City Hall. 
He said that after his many appearances in court, filing appeals and paying 
legal fees, he has been forced to file bankruptcy. "Lawyers aren't cheap," he 
said, estimating that his expenses have run "into the thousands of dollars." 
Nevertheless, Hall seems to relish his role as Savannah iconoclast. "I'm amused 
by the whole thing," he said. "I don't know what I'll do next."
