One Thursday last month, Jim Roache popped in unannounced at Pershing Junior 
High in San Carlos for a tour, part of his periodic efforts as a San Diego city 
school board member to get an unvarnished, grass-roots feel for trends and 
complaints. 
During the school lunch break, Principal Bill Hassett took Roache, who commands 
the county sheriff's substation in Lemon Grove, to chat with three math 
teachers eating in the no-smoking lounge. Roache immediately engaged the three 
in a lively discussion about the school district's new common core curriculum, 
an idea he co-sponsored last year. The core, now being phased in, will require 
all secondary school students to take college preparatory courses in basic 
subject areas, including algebra. 
The math teachers decried the plan, saying that some students simply cannot be 
taught algebra and that to require such classes will bring only further 
frustration to teacher and student, and could result in more dropouts. 
As Roache turned to leave after 20 minutes of animated questions and answers, 
one teacher asked him what he did for a living. 
"I'm in law enforcement," Roache replied, realizing the teacher had no idea he 
had been talking to a school board member. 
"Well, if ever you are with school administrators, you'll find they're the ones 
cramming this thing down our throats," the teacher said. 
"I think maybe I could plead guilty to being part of that," Roache laughed as 
he left. 
Impact Outstrips Recognition 
The incident is illustrative of the fact that although many San Diegans -- even 
within the 11,000-employee school district -- may not recognize first-term 
board member Roache by face or name, they are keenly aware of his impact in 
changing the shape of local schools. 
Roache, finishing up only his second year as a school trustee, has surprised 
both administrators and fellow board members with his aggressive stance on 
reform issues. The many board initiatives under way have helped catapult San 
Diego into the forefront of districts nationwide that are experimenting -- at 
times with controversy -- with new ways of teaching. 
The 42-year-old Roache has belied the image he brought to the board: that of an 
inflexible right-wing ideologue. He is praised for his hard work, his 
willingness to listen and his enjoyment of debate without hidden agendas. 
Observers say he marks a substantial change in representation for his area in 
the the city's northeastern tier. Predecessor Larry Lester was an 
often-inflexible conservative member who delighted in staking out extreme 
positions. 
Last month, Roache was elected the board's vice president as a prelude to 
becoming president next year. 
"I think Jim is doing a good job, although he comes from a conservative point 
of view," said colleague Kay Davis, the board's senior member, who has had her 
share of disagreements with Roache during the past two years, in particular 
over core curriculum. 
"He has very strong opinions, and sometimes he doesn't know everything about an 
issue before forming that strong opinion, and then you have to convince him to 
look at a different way or conclusion. 
"But what saves him is that he really is a pragmatist who realizes this is not 
a perfect world . . . " she said. 
District Supt. Tom Payzant said Roache has surprised many people, including 
himself. 
No Game Playing 
"I guess I thought he would be more ideological and have a stereotypical 
conservative agenda, however people wanted to define that, based on the 
consensus of what people were expecting," Payzant said. 
"But I have found him very open-minded, receptive to good data and 
well-reasoned argument, and his candor and ability to go to the heart of issues 
are very refreshing. Plus he has a good sense of humor. 
"He has no hidden agendas and does no game playing, and that is commendable in 
public policy-making," Payzant said. "We do disagree at times, but he also has 
also taken risks and told his community things that they don't necessarily want 
to hear. That makes him very effective over the long haul in understanding the 
conflict at times between representing the people of his district and the best 
interests of students in all of San Diego." 
Dorothy Smith, who retired last month after eight years on the board 
representing heavily minority areas, said Roache has the potential to be the 
group's most influential member. 
In May, 1987, Smith and Roache formed an alliance, considered unusual by some 
at the time, to push the core curriculum with colleagues and top administrators 
who were initially less than enthusiastic. 
"Despite my own misgivings at first -- I thought he was a little naive -- I 
soon found he really cared for kids," Smith said, citing a talk Roache gave at 
the dedication of DePortola Middle School in early 1987. "I didn't know what 
deep feelings he had for education until I heard him speak that day about 
patriotism, about high standards for all children (a longtime priority for 
Smith) and how education will affect America's future. 
"He opened his heart that day, and I was in tears at the end." 
Knew He'd Be Stereotyped 
The lean, intense sheriff's captain said he knew he would be stereotyped when 
he joined the board. After all, his 1986 election opponent, Sue Braun, had 
labled Roache's background as simply "jails, jails, jails" in mocking his 
campaign for an education office. Roache won the final vote by a scant 903 
ballots. 
"People said, 'He's a cop, he's a non-educator, he's a white male, and he comes 
from a predominantly Caucasian district.' And in their minds, that added up to 
a right-wing, red-necked, kick-ass, take-names conservative," Roache said. 
"Sure, I am a conservative, but to me, that means a value system that at its 
base says that education is important to society, and that means my objective 
is to have all kids receive the best possible education no matter what color 
they are or where they come from." 
Both his own uneven educational background and his 18 years in law enforcement, 
often dealing with school-related problems, have helped bring forth not a 
cynical view of society, as many administrators assumed, but rather a sense 
that all things are possible. 
Roache acknowledges that he stayed in high school -- he graduated from 
Twentynine Palms High north of Palm Springs -- only because of athletics, and 
he dropped out of Grossmont College before joining the Air Force in the 
mid-1960s. 
Only after several years of supporting a wife and child on an enlisted man's 
sparse salary did Roache realize he needed further education to make more of 
his life. He returned to community college and eventually graduated from San 
Diego State University. 
Key Is Building Blocks 
"That is why the common core concept has been so important to me," Roache said. 
"A lot of kids are like I was, who don't know where they are going, who have no 
immediate goals. But at some point in the future, they will develop a plan, and 
the key is to give them the fundamental academic building blocks so that they 
won't be encumbered by poor basic educational preparation like I was when I 
matured. 
"They'll still have to work hard, but at least they will stand a chance of 
making it more quickly," he said. 
Roache also links the core concept to his years in dealing with juveniles in 
trouble with the law. 
"Look, I'm a blue-collar type of guy, and I make no pretense to be an 
intellectual," Roache said. "But when I see a kid picked up for burglary or 
whatever, I sometimes talk with them and I see a chance is still there, that 
almost no one is beyond salvation and that there is always the chance that 
somebody will connect with them to turn them around." 
In his position as station commander, Roache oversees all contacts between his 
officers and public schools in the Grossmont and Lemon Grove school districts, 
giving him an additional perspective on school-related issues. Grossmont Union 
High School District Supt. Robert Pyle consults periodically with Roache on 
issues from violence to drugs. 
Roache concedes that other San Diego board members, such as Kay Davis, have 
questioned his commitment to programs for children identified as gifted or for 
advanced placement testing for students ticketed for blue-chip universities. 
Wants Them to Have the Option 
"I do care about those programs because those children are going to be our 
future doctors and physicists," Roache said. "But I am firmly convinced that 
the great portion of our future leaders, from clergy to politicians, are going 
to be from the vast, amorphous group of regular education kids, and they are 
going to end up driving our culture. 
"I want the common core so that more of these kids will have the options of 
being among our future leaders." 
The hard-charging style with which Roache has approached life admittedly has 
clashed with the nature of school board decision making. 
"I am impatient, I want to see quick results, but I know that on a lot of 
issues, the quick fix won't work and that it takes time on long-range, complex 
things such as the core," Roache said. 
"Ideally, I would have liked to have had the core curriculum implemented 
everywhere at once. But my philosophy is also to be pragmatic, to take a little 
at a time if you can't persuade everyone of the validity of the entire program. 
The reality of implementation involves budgets and teachers and administrators, 
and I know from my own experience (he oversees 40 people with an annual budget 
of $1.5 million) that it must be a group effort. . . . I need to give others 
more time to work through things." 
Roache has staked out clear positions on two major issues expected to come 
before the board in 1989: a possible change to district-only elections and the 
idea of health clinics at schools. 
Relishes the Debate 
On both, he appears opposed to positions of the two new board members, Ann 
Armstrong and Shirley Weber, but Roache said he looks forward to honest debate 
and, where possible, compromise. 
Already, Roache arranged for the board to meet in an informal workshop last 
month where members could learn about their colleagues' philosophies candidly 
and firsthand, rather than relying on media reports as the previous board did 
in forming its first impressions of Roache. 
He cites his own votes on year-round schools as a reason for keeping the 
present system of electing school board members, rather than opting for 
elections by geographic district only. (Currently, two finalists are nominated 
in a primary by voters in their geographic district, but compete in the entire 
school district in the final election.) Roache went against the wishes of many 
in the upscale, influential Scripps Ranch area in 1987 by supporting Payzant's 
recommendation to have the area's elementary school, Jerabek, go year-round on 
a four-track schedule to relieve overcrowding. 
"I realize that some constituents still feel I sold them down the river," 
Roache said. After more than a year of implementation, the year-round schedule 
is said to be going smoothly. 
"But if I voted in opposition, how in good conscience could I tell some other 
school or some other community in San Diego to go multi-track year-round? Yet 
if we had district-only elections, I don't know how I could risk making such a 
vote and not become the target of organized special interests and community 
activists, who have great power within districts, at the next election." 
Controversy Could Erupt 
On the issue of health clinics, Roache was told last month by Hassett, the 
principal at Pershing, that clinics are needed because too many children do not 
have regular medical care until their illnesses become crises. 
"How you do it given the controversy that could erupt, I don't know," Hassett 
said, referring to a wrenching board debate that occurred three years ago over 
the issue of providing birth control and abortion information. The board voted 
3 to 2 against a Payzant plan for the clinics. Roache's predecessor, Lester, 
led the battle against them. 
However, both new members, Weber and Armstrong, favor clinics and, together 
with board President Susan Davis, could provide the majority needed to 
establish them. 
"I agree that there is a legitimate need for health care services for 
adolescents and youth and it is not being met now," Roache said. "I have 
political reservations about whether that is proper for schools, but the 
practical side of me says that society is paying a tremendous cost because it 
isn't being done elsewhere. 
"If some program can be designed for those services, I would favor it. But if 
you add birth control and abortion aspects, that offends me. I want some 
parental contact included when you do that, even though I know a lot of parents 
don't talk to their children about (sex-related) matters and that some kids 
don't have parents to talk to. 
"But it just offends me if we don't bring the parent or guardian into the 
process on the campus. . . . By not doing so, we are saying we know what is 
best for their kid despite any moral or religious values of the family, or that 
parents aren't thinking right on the issue. 
"On the one hand, we are arguing in all our reform efforts that parent support 
is vital for the success of school, but we don't want them there when it comes 
to pregnancy or sex." 
Roache said he will work for compromise if both sides are amenable. Despite his 
feelings on family planning, he supports programs at several high schools that 
allow teen-age mothers to continue their schooling while receiving child care 
and birth control information. 
"You can't just throw the kids out of school," Roache said. "This is a real, 
real difficult issue, and we have to avoid the extremism of both sides."
