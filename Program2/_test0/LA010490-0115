It's dead noon, time for most of the workaday world to grab lunch, run a rushed 
errand or begin pining for quitting time. On the back porch of his Faria Beach 
home, Jack Cantrell reaches into a storage bin and plucks out his surfboard. 
The sun is shining, the day is young and, a stone's throw away, there's surf to 
be had. 
"Last week I surfed seven days straight, I was actually getting surfed out," 
beamed Cantrell, obviously bothered not a whit by the prospect of doing it 
again. "Let's go surfing." 
A robust 61, Cantrell, a lifelong Ventura County resident, has spent the last 
37 years surfing local waters, one of a surprising number of surfers 
approaching Social Security without abandoning the sport they love. 
"I think people would generally be amazed by the number of older people who 
surf," said Paul Holmes, editor of Surfer magazine. "Surfing's a very thrilling 
thing -- it captures people's imaginations, they want to do it more and more. 
That applies to 16-year-olds and 60-year-olds. The fact of the matter is, if 
people who are surfing keep it up, there's no reason why they should have to 
quit because of age." 
"When I come out of the water, I feel like a newborn kid," said Cantrell, 
recently retired owner of an oil delivery company. "I've felt that way all my 
life. Why should I stop?" 
Many don't. Surfing legend Lewis (Hoppy) Swarts surfed into his 70s -- at 67, 
Swarts won a Grandmasters West Coast Surfing Assn. championship competing 
against surfers 20 years his junior. Dorian Paskowitz, a 69-year-old physician 
and professed "surf junkie," lives out of a camper van, parked, more often than 
not, at water's edge. Big-wave pioneer Wally Froiseth, also 69, still surfs 
regularly in his home waters off Hawaii. Surfer magazine's Holmes watched his 
father surf well into his 70s. 
"When I started surfing, he looked at it and said, 'Why not? I can do this,' " 
said Holmes. "He was 56 at the time." 
Holmes calls the older surfers "patriarchal figures." Others are less kind. A 
favorite seniors' surf spot at San Onofre beach has been dubbed "Old Man's" 
because the waves there are notoriously soft and forgiving. Age, however, has 
its perks -- among them free time and a thick skin. 
"Don't care what they say," grinned Kent Atwater. "I just hope they're saying 
it when I'm 80." 
Atwater, a wiry 60-year-old Ventura resident whose license plate holder reads, 
"I'd rather be surfing," does exactly that as often as he can. A local real 
estate agent, Atwater has reached that comfortable, nothing-pressing era when 
life's immediate needs have been provided for and its other needs no longer 
seem so immediate. Which, from a surfer's standpoint, is nothing short of 
nirvana. 
"I can get out whenever the surf is up," said Atwater. "If it's good, I just 
hang it up and go." 
Age also has another advantage. Cantrell has become such a fixture in the 
waters off Faria Beach that each venture into the surf becomes something of an 
old-home week. Friends nod acknowledgments, and complete strangers paddle over 
to chew the fat. Over the years younger surfers have occasionally given him a 
hard time, stealing his waves and generally being a nuisance, but, says 
Cantrell, time has a neat way of taking care of that. 
"Sometimes there'd be a bunch who wanted to get rid of me -- they didn't want 
the old man there," said Cantrell, "but it always seemed like the guys who made 
it tough for you one year were your buddies the following year. They'd just 
mature a little bit. As a whole, people are really very nice to me." 
Surfer magazine's Holmes believes that those over 50 have reached a "golden 
age" when they receive a modicum of respect, and more important their share of 
waves, from the younger surfers. 
"The surfers in their 50s and 60s get better treatment than the guys in their 
30s and 40s," said Holmes. "I think that the kids really appreciate it that 
these guys are still getting out there and enjoying it." 
Atwater has a simpler theory. 
"Either they respect my age," laughed Atwater, "or they're afraid I'm going to 
have a heart attack and die and they don't want to be responsible." 
In fact, Atwater is not above broadcasting his age if it behooves him. Atwater 
celebrated his 60th birthday by boating out to Santa Cruz Island for a surf at 
one of his favorite spots. He arrived to find the spot jumping, eight-foot 
waves rolling out of the Pacific expanse and exploding onto a shallow rock 
bottom. Thrilled, he hopped overboard and paddled up to the small knot of 
surfers sitting in the water. 
"I paddled up to these kids and said, 'Hey you guys, this is my 60th birthday, 
so you have to let me have a wave," recalled Atwater. "They said, 'Fine, gee 
that's great.' I took one and screwed it up completely. . . . My reflexes 
aren't what they used to be, particularly if I'm surfing in a place where the 
waves are big and fast and I haven't been out in a while." 
A lifelong big-wave aficionado who stays in shape by swimming and playing 
tennis during flat spells, Atwater says there is really little difference 
between the Atwater of today and the Atwater of 40 years ago. 
"I really don't get any more tired than I used to and, in my mind, I'm as good 
as I ever was," said Atwater. "And I tell you, I get just as excited about it 
now as I ever did." 
Atwater does, however, admit it may be time to impose some size limits -- a 
decision reached, in part, after a particularly severe drubbing several years 
ago on a 15-foot day at Rincon, a world-renowned surfing break on the 
Ventura-Santa Barbara border known for its sometimes large and powerful waves. 
"I caught this one wave and it just crushed me, ripped my leash and my boot 
right off my foot and spun me around underwater for what seemed like forever. I 
don't think I'll do that again," said Atwater, who, two years later was out in 
surf big enough to break his board in two. 
Like Atwater, Cantrell also recognizes self-imposed limits, then stretches 
those limits whenever it suits him. When there is something pressing on the 
day's schedule, Cantrell's wife, Joyce, signals the end of a surf session by 
hanging a towel over the porch railing. Familial obligations aside, Cantrell is 
on his own. 
"I can tell when he's tired," said Joyce Cantrell, who often watches her 
husband from the deck of their home. "Sometimes I get concerned, but most of 
the time it doesn't bother me. He's over 21. He knows his limits." 
Well, yes and no. 
"Sometimes it's hard for me to get out," admitted Cantrell. "You always want 
that last wave to be a good one." 
Though it would be tempting to carry on about the experience years bring, older 
surfers are frank. 
"Sure, you make plenty concessions to age," said Bill Lucking, who, at 72, has 
been an avid bodysurfer for almost 40 years. "I don't have the stamina that I 
used to, I get cold faster. Basically I'm not as tough as I once was. But it's 
still fun." 
So much fun that Lucking is in the water an average of six days a week, 
generally bobbing in the often roiling surf off Ventura's South Jetty, a 
popular bodysurfing spot. Though Lucking recently retired from his Ventura law 
practice, during his working days he was still a South Jetty regular. In fact, 
work demanded it. 
"I used to go out for an hour lunch and I'd come back to work and find myself 
reading the same paragraph three times trying to figure out what it meant," 
said Lucking. "Bodysurfing changed that. Spending lunch in the water, I came 
back sharp and alert." 
Lucking scoffs at the idea of serving as an example to younger surfers, but, 
like it or not, there are plenty of young whippersnappers who emulate him. 
"It's neat to see that there's somebody older than you that's still doing it. 
It gives you the faith to hang in there," said Warren Glaser, an avid surfer 
who, at 53, still isn't old enough to escape an occasional lecture from his 
mother, who reckons he's far too old for this. 
"Yep, still nags me," said Glaser. " 'Adults don't do things like this,' 'It's 
not proper for your age,' things like that." 
Glaser, who started bodysurfing at age 12 and picked up board surfing as a 
16-year-old Ventura lifeguard, reckons that older watermen may be up against a 
force even more relentless than Mom. 
"Blood plasma and salt water have almost the same chemical composition and I 
think that's the way it is for a lot of the older generation," said Glaser. "It 
just gets in your blood and you just can't get it out. There's no sense 
trying." 
So they don't. Glaser figures he'll surf until he dies and says that, if he has 
a choice, "I hope I go that way." Lucking, Cantrell and Atwater aren't placing 
any limits on their surfing careers either. 
"I'll take it one year at a time," said Cantrell. "Now my goal is to surf until 
I'm 62.
